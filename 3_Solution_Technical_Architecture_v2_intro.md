\# Solution Architecture & Key Innovations

The Elephant protocol deploys on Polygon’s Layer 2 infrastructure to
achieve immediate scalability while maintaining sub-cent transaction
costs essential for high-volume property data operations. This technical
architecture combines on-chain verification with off-chain storage
through IPFS, creating a hybrid system that balances immutability with
economic efficiency. Rather than building another blockchain from
scratch, we leverage proven infrastructure to focus engineering
resources on the core challenge: creating a unified data layer that
transforms fragmented property information into composable, verifiable
digital assets.
