\## Live Data Integrity

The protocol’s economic model extends beyond initial data verification
to maintain live data integrity throughout a property’s lifecycle. Real
estate is dynamic—properties change hands, undergo renovations, face
legal actions, and experience countless other events that affect their
fundamental characteristics. Traditional systems charge repeatedly for
verifying this changing information, extracting $31.1 billion annually
just for data verification services that produce no lasting value.

Elephant’s Live Data Integrity mechanism ensures that once property data
enters the blockchain, it remains current and accurate in perpetuity.
Oracles are economically incentivized to monitor their assigned fact
groups continuously. When a change occurs—such as a property sale,
permit filing, or lien placement—the oracle network must update the
on-chain data as quickly as possible.

The economics of live updates create a competitive marketplace for
truth. If an oracle fails to update changed data promptly, any other
oracle can submit the update and claim both the update rewards and the
governance rights (vMAHOUT) associated with that fact group. This
creates a powerful incentive for oracles to maintain vigilance over
their assigned properties, ensuring the entire network benefits from
real-time, accurate data.
