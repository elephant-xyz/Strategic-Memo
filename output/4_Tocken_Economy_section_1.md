All MAHOUT is minted through verified oracle contributions using the Proof of Truth mechanism. The genesis supply starts at zero with no pre-sale, no VC allocation, and no passive farming---only validated data earns tokens. The total supply is fixed at 150 million tokens, matching the estimated number of properties in the United States.

Each property can mint exactly one MAHOUT token once all 20 fact groups are submitted and validated. These 20 data groups contain everything from ownership records and mortgage details to permits and environmental characteristics, each with predetermined allocation weights. The County data group receives the largest allocation at 60% of the property's MAHOUT, reflecting its foundational importance. The Root data group receives 8%, Photo Metadata receives 15%, and HOA receives 1%. The remaining 16 data groups each receive 1% allocations.

MAHOUT issuance serves a critical bootstrapping function: accelerating data density creation across the network. As properties become comprehensively verified through all 20 fact groups, the network flywheel begins spinning, attracting service providers and generating the economic activity that sustains long-term protocol operations.
