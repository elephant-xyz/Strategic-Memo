Three distinct participant roles drive the Elephant economy, each with aligned incentives that reinforce system integrity. Oracles earn MAHOUT tokens by bringing verified property data on-chain and maintaining its accuracy over time. Service providers stake MAHOUT to advertise on property fact sheets, creating a competitive marketplace for professional services. Transaction participants pay modest fees that fund ongoing operations and reward contributors. This triangular economy ensures sustainable growth: more properties create more fact sheets, attracting more service providers, generating more fees, incentivizing more oracles, who verify more properties.

The system makes honesty more profitable than deception at every level. Oracles who submit accurate data earn tokens and governance power. Those who submit false data lose their stakes and reputation. Service providers who deliver quality attract clients through prominent placement. Those who disappoint see their staked positions challenged by competitors. Every economic mechanism reinforces the core principle: value creation beats value extraction.

All MAHOUT is minted only through active data work using the Proof of Truth mechanism. Genesis token supply starts at zero; all tokens are earned by oracles through verified contributions. Proof of Truth requires oracles to submit valid, fresh data updates in real time; whoever submits verified truth first earns mining rewards and vMAHOUT. No pre-sale, no VC allocations, no passive farmingâ€”only verified work earns tokens.
