Elephant demonstrates Bitstrapping's practical application for infrastructure
protocols. The campaign parameters reflect careful modeling of transaction fee
revenues and development requirements, creating a template for future
implementations.

The fundraising structure targets 2,500 BTC, providing 3-year runway at \$200k
monthly burn plus repayment buffer and development contingencies. The 3-year
lock period allows MVP development, national rollout, and revenue generation
before repayment obligations begin. MAHOUT allocation comes from the DAO
treasury's share---since approximately 70% of all MAHOUT is mined by oracles
through Proof of Truth, the DAO's 30% allocation provides tokens for ecosystem
development including Bitstrapping rewards.

Repayment terms specify 15% of contributed Bitcoin value in USDC, payable in
quarterly installments beginning Month 37. This creates predictable cash flows
for both protocol and contributors. The utility structure provides concrete
value: 50% transaction fee discounts create immediate savings for users,
governance rights ensure contributor voice in protocol development, priority
oracle assignment access rewards early supporters, and revenue sharing above
operational costs aligns long-term interests.

Success metrics demonstrate realistic projections grounded in market analysis:

$$\text{Break-even Transactions} = \frac{\text{Monthly Operations}}{\text{Fee per Transaction}} = \frac{\$200{,}000}{\$4} = 50{,}000$$

$$\text{Repayment Coverage} = \frac{\text{Quarterly Repayment}}{\text{Net Revenue per Transaction}} = 150{,}000 \text{ transactions/month}$$

Current projections exceed 500,000 monthly transactions by Year 3 based on
market penetration models, providing substantial buffer above repayment
requirements.

This structure ensures Bitcoin contributors benefit from both token appreciation
and preserved Bitcoin value. The DAO allocates MAHOUT from its treasury to early
supporters---for example, a 10 BTC contributor might receive MAHOUT tokens worth
approximately 25 BTC at projected Year 3 volumes (based on utility value from
transaction fee discounts), plus 1.5 BTC stablecoin repayment, while retaining
their original 10 BTC. This creates attractive returns while preserving the
integrity of the Proof of Truth mining system where oracles earn the majority of
tokens through verified data contributions.
