Once economic incentives reward truth over extraction, the protocol creates conditions for transformation that extends far beyond individual transactions to reshape entire economic structures. When technical infrastructure eliminates systematic inefficiencies and token economics reward value creation, the effects cascade through household wealth, capital markets, and social mobility in ways that fundamentally alter how society organizes around property ownership.

The transformation of real estate from an extractive industry consuming $234.8 billion annually to an efficient market requiring only $29.6 billion represents more than cost savings—it catalyzes fundamental economic and social restructuring. When $205.2 billion redirects from intermediary extraction to productive use, the effects ripple through household wealth, capital markets, and economic opportunity. This 89% reduction in transaction friction doesn’t merely save money; it reimagines property as a liquid, accessible, programmable asset class that serves homeowners rather than gatekeepers.
