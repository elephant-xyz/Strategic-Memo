Elephant’s data model achieves true global applicability by making no assumptions about local legal systems while
providing complete flexibility for jurisdiction-specific requirements. This neutrality enables a single protocol to
handle property transactions from Manhattan skyscrapers to Mumbai apartments to São Paulo favelas without architectural
changes.

The key insight: legal differences are schema variations, not protocol modifications. US property ownership differs from
UK leasehold systems in schema definitions, not fundamental architecture. Islamic finance prohibitions on interest
require different mortgage schemas, not different protocols. Community land trusts, indigenous property rights, and
socialist property models become schema variations rather than incompatible systems.

This flexibility extends to evolution within jurisdictions. When regulations change, new schema versions capture new
requirements while historical transactions remain valid under original schemas. Grandfathering provisions are explicit
in schema version references rather than complex legal interpretations. Cross-border transactions reference multiple
schemas, ensuring compliance with all relevant jurisdictions.

The protocol provides schema composition primitives for complex scenarios. Multi-jurisdictional transactions compose
schemas: a Canadian buying US property through a Cayman Islands entity references Canadian, US, and Cayman schemas. Each
schema validates its relevant aspects while composition rules ensure compatibility. This modular approach scales to
arbitrary complexity without central coordination.

Dispute resolution benefits from explicit schema references. Rather than arguing about applicable law, parties reference
specific schema versions. Smart contracts can encode choice-of-schema clauses similar to choice-of-law provisions. This
clarity reduces legal uncertainty and enables automated dispute resolution for schema-defined issues.
