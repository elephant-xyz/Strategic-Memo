The American real estate market operates through deliberate forgetting. Every property transaction begins at zero knowledge, requiring full re-verification of information that was verified last year, and the year before, and every year stretching back decades. This engineered memory loss costs billions per transaction in redundant data verification---money spent not to discover new information but to rediscover what was already known. Multiply this across 5.5 million annual transactions, and we burn \$31.1 billion yearly on collective forgetfulness, a tax that enriches verification providers while impoverishing families.

This systematic inefficiency represents merely the visible symptom of deeper structural failures. The real estate industry wasn't designed for efficiency or transparency---it was architected by intermediaries, for intermediaries. Agents, brokers, bureaucrats, and administrators, almost none of whom possess technical expertise, have constructed manual systems of staggering complexity. As regulation expands and data requirements multiply, these analog processes don't scale linearly but exponentially, creating ever-more-lucrative opportunities for gatekeeping. The solution is a real estate oracle network which removes gatekeepers, creates persistent data memory, and creates transparency of process and pricing.
