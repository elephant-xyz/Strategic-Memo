Properties exist in Elephant as minted digital data assets, not merely as database entries or document repositories.
Each asset embeds verified, cryptographically signed data snapshots while maintaining dynamic lifecycle support for the
continuous changes that define real property. This approach recognizes that real estate is not static—properties are
bought, sold, renovated, refinanced, and transformed throughout their existence.

The protocol enables programmable ownership, transfers, upgrades, and event tracking through smart contracts that
understand property lifecycles. When a renovation adds value, the property record updates automatically. When ownership
transfers, the entire verified history travels with the asset. When liens attach or release, the changes reflect
instantly across all systems. This permanence and programmability reduce data verification costs from $8,600 to $2,400
per transaction—a 72% reduction that compounds over millions of annual transactions.
