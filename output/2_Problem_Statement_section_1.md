Real estate’s fundamental design principle centers on intermediation. The names themselves clearly signal this intent: broker, agent—roles that exist to position themselves between parties who could otherwise transact directly. These intermediaries, largely non-technical administrators and bureaucrats, have constructed manual systems that reflect their own limitations rather than market needs. As regulation expands and data requirements multiply, these analog processes scale exponentially in complexity and cost, creating ever-more-lucrative opportunities for gatekeeping.

The MLS and GSE gatekeepers control data access and enforce mandated transaction pathways with severely limited consumer choice. By controlling property listings and transaction infrastructure, they guarantee their position in every deal. Multiple separate counterparties maintain partial, incompatible records across America’s 3,000 counties, each charging for their fragment of truth. None communicate effectively with others. The absence of interoperability represents a deliberate business model feature rather than a technical limitation.

What makes this system particularly insidious is its opacity regarding itself. The central authorities intentionally publish no data about service provider quality, average fees, or closed volumes. This allows low-quality vendors to remain in the market and service unwitting customers without consequence. A bad title agent can operate for decades without market discipline because performance data never surfaces. Given the protected position of these gatekeepers, market forces cannot incentivize better products at lower costs.

The gatekeeping apparatus maintains its position through multiple defensive mechanisms. Licensing requirements block open competition. Wasteful 99-hour continuing education mandates create artificial barriers to entry. Ethics pledges enforced by the NAR provide moral cover for systematic extraction. Overtly signaled price collusion maintains 6% commissions across markets. Heavy-handed competitive restrictions, as seen in battles between Rocket Mortgage and UWM, demonstrate the lengths to which incumbents will go to preserve their positions.
