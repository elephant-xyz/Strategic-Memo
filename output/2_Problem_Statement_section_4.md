The incentive alignment between agents, brokers, service providers, and sellers creates a unified force toward asset price inflation. This represents a key contributor to housing unaffordability that compounds over time. Natural competitive market forces remain absent because competition gets stifled and true pricing stays expertly hidden.

Fee layers accumulate across multiple refinancing cycles and holding periods, compounding consumer costs while creating high-water marks that prevent prices from declining. A family owning a home for seven years pays \$9,594 annually in transaction costs—a hidden tax that enriches intermediaries while impoverishing households. These costs embed in property values and compound with each subsequent sale.

The macroeconomic impact ripples through society in ways that extend far beyond individual transactions. When transaction costs consume 16.3% of property value, labor mobility freezes. Workers cannot afford to relocate for better opportunities. Families delay moves, living in suboptimal housing because transaction costs become prohibitive. Young buyers get priced out entirely, not by home values but by transaction friction. Wealth accumulation stalls as equity evaporates into fees rather than building generational assets.

Recent technology companies like Compass, Better, and Opendoor attempted to address these problems but achieved the reverse—scaling traditional business models with unproven technology while remaining trapped within existing regulatory frameworks, creating new inefficiencies rather than eliminating old ones.
