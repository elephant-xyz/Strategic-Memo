Natural competitive market forces are totally absent since competition is stifled and the true price/cost of everything
is expertly hidden and muted. Fee layers accumulate across multiple refinancing cycles and hold periods, compounding
consumer cost over time. A family owning a home for seven years pays $9,594 annually just in transaction costs—a hidden
tax that enriches intermediaries while impoverishing households.

The macroeconomic impact ripples through society. When transaction costs consume 16.3% of property value, labor mobility
freezes. Workers can’t afford to relocate for better opportunities. Families delay moves, living in suboptimal housing
because transaction costs are prohibitive. Young buyers are priced out entirely, not by home values but by transaction
friction. Wealth accumulation stalls as equity evaporates into fees. The entire economy suffers from misallocated
resources, reduced productivity, and decreased dynamism.
