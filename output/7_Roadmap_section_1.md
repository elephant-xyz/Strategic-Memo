The protocol’s transformation begins with verifier staking contracts that turn passive observers into active truth miners. These contracts create a living accountability system where every oracle’s economic fate ties directly to data quality, with slashing mechanisms executing automatically when false data is detected while rewards flow continuously to accurate verifiers. This foundational phase establishes the credibility that makes all subsequent phases possible.

We conducted a time study to verify that the protocol’s mining infrastructure scales effectively through distributed implementation across America’s 3,000 counties. We’ve established that a part-time oracle can verify 2-4 counties containing 200-500k properties per week. We are already actively minting property data on-chain, with early results confirming that all US property records can be comprehensively verified within 12-18 months through distributed mining across jurisdictions.

This represents the first true ’mining’ process for real estate data, where computational work and time investment create permanent, verifiable value rather than repeated verification costs. The fragmented county structure that currently creates inefficiency becomes an advantage for distributed mining—rather than requiring centralized coordination, oracles work independently across jurisdictions, creating natural parallelization that accelerates comprehensive coverage.

Property data is legally accessible in all jurisdictions, ensuring that oracles have proper access to information needed for verification. While variability exists in historical record depth, this is overcome through off-chain oracles accessing county databases, clerk records, and other official sources. The combination of legal accessibility and distributed mining creates conditions for rapid, comprehensive data coverage that scales naturally with participation.

Oracle onboarding follows a precise sequence designed to build momentum through early success. Initial oracles are recruited from three pools: existing real estate data professionals seeking additional revenue streams, crypto-native participants looking for mining opportunities, and technology companies with real estate data access. Licensed service providers—title companies, appraisers, inspectors, and mortgage brokers—can participate as oracles within their existing professional frameworks, requiring no changes to current licensing or regulatory compliance.

The oracle submission interface provides clear workflows: connect data sources, submit cryptographic proofs, earn immediate rewards. Training materials walk through specific examples while weekly office hours provide direct support. Early oracle achievements receive public recognition, creating social proof that attracts additional participants and builds community around accurate data contribution.
