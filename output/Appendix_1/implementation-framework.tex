\section{Implementation Framework}

Implementing Bitstrapping requires careful balance between standardization and customization. While core mechanics remain consistent—Bitcoin locking, token minting, repayment obligations—specific parameters must match protocol characteristics and market conditions.

Key parameters for protocol designers include lock period optimization, where 2-4 years typically balances Bitcoin holder patience with protocol development needs. Token pricing at 20-40\% discount to projected utility value rewards early supporters without excessive dilution. Repayment percentages of 10-20\% of Bitcoin value in stablecoins balance protocol sustainability with attractive returns.

Contribution caps prevent whale dominance while ensuring sufficient fundraising, with typical ranges of 10-50 BTC individual caps and 1000-5000 BTC total raises. Token utility must be clear and enforceable—fee discounts, governance rights, priority access, and revenue sharing create natural demand, while pure governance or speculative tokens violate the model's principles.

Launch sequencing follows a proven pattern for market reception. Successful campaigns publish detailed protocol documentation demonstrating revenue potential, deploy audited smart contracts with clear terms, open contributions for fixed periods of 30-60 days, then close fundraising at cap or deadline. Development proceeds with transparent milestones, leading to protocol launch with immediate token utility, revenue generation supporting repayment, and on-schedule obligation fulfillment that builds reputation for future rounds.

The smart contract architecture prioritizes simplicity and auditability. Complex upgrade paths introduce risk; immutable contracts with clear parameters build trust. Time locks, multi-signature controls, and predetermined token minting curves create credible commitments that attract serious capital.
