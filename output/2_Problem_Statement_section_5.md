The problem is centralization itself. The solution is systematic decentralization that works within existing legal structures rather than requiring regulatory change. Real estate data must be anchored on blockchain rails as public infrastructure, transforming gatekept commodities into freely accessible public goods. Property records—including ownership, mortgage, servicing, appraisal, and upgrades—become independent data layers that attach incrementally through modular architecture.

This transformation requires cryptographic attestations from independent providers, with staking, slashing, and rewards aligning data provider incentives toward accuracy rather than extraction. Service providers can continue operating within existing licensing frameworks while gaining access to verified data and transparent performance metrics. Borrower personal financial data remains off-chain in early protocol phases, with privacy-preserving cryptography supporting private data in later phases.

The system builds industry memory that captures longitudinal asset lifecycle and reputation history, creating permanent knowledge rather than perpetual forgetting. Shared data access lowers verification costs, reduces transaction friction, and removes capital market barriers that currently exclude broad populations from property ownership. This represents systematic replacement rather than incremental reform.

Where the current system profits from forgetting, decentralized infrastructure creates permanent memory. Where gatekeepers control access, permissionless participation becomes the default. Where opacity enables extraction, transparency becomes mathematically enforced. The transformation operates through superior utility rather than confrontation. When verification costs approach zero, when data flows freely, when trust emerges from mathematics rather than institutions, the extractive machinery simply stops working. Market forces naturally drive adoption toward efficiency, transparency, and service rather than gatekeeping, friction, and extraction. The revolution happens not through destruction but through construction of something fundamentally better.
