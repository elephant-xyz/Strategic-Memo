Centralization is the problem. Decentralization is the solution. Real estate data must be anchored on decentralized blockchain rails as public infrastructure. Property records including ownership, mortgage, servicing, appraisal, and upgrades become independent data layers. Data is ingested through cryptographic attestations from independent providers. Staking, slashing, and rewards align data provider incentives.

Modular architecture allows verified data layers to attach incrementally. Borrower personal financial data remains off-chain in early protocol phases. Privacy-preserving cryptography will support borrower data in later phases. Industry memory captures longitudinal asset lifecycle and reputation history. Shared data access lowers verification costs, transaction friction, and capital market barriers.

This isn’t incremental reform but systematic replacement. Where the current system profits from forgetting, we create permanent memory. Where gatekeepers control access, we enable permissionless participation. Where opacity enables extraction, we enforce transparency. Where misaligned incentives corrupt outcomes, we align rewards with value creation. The solution doesn’t negotiate with the problem—it obsoletes it entirely.
