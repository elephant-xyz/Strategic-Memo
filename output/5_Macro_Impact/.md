# Macro Impact

The transformation of real estate from an extractive industry consuming
\$234.8 billion annually to an efficient market requiring only \$29.6
billion represents more than cost savings---it catalyzes fundamental
economic and social restructuring. When \$205.2 billion redirects from
intermediary extraction to productive use, the effects ripple through
household wealth, capital markets, and social mobility. This 89%
reduction in transaction friction doesn't merely save money; it
reimagines property as a liquid, accessible, programmable asset class
that serves humanity rather than gatekeepers.
