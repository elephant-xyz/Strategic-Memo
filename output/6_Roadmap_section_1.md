The protocol’s heartbeat begins with verifier staking contracts that transform passive observers into active truth
miners. These contracts don’t merely hold tokens—they create a living accountability system where every oracle’s
economic fate ties directly to data quality. Slashing mechanisms execute automatically when false data is detected,
while rewards flow continuously to accurate verifiers.

Tactically, oracle onboarding follows a precise sequence. First, we identify and recruit initial oracles from three
pools: existing real estate data professionals seeking additional revenue, crypto-native participants looking for mining
opportunities, and technology companies with real estate data access. These early oracles receive direct outreach,
technical support, and enhanced rewards during the bootstrap phase.

The oracle submission interface provides these participants with clear workflows: connect data sources, submit
cryptographic proofs, earn immediate rewards. Training materials walk through specific examples—how to verify a property
sale, how to confirm permit issuance, how to validate mortgage recordings. Weekly office hours provide direct support.
Early oracle achievements get highlighted publicly, creating social proof that attracts additional participants.

Dispute resolution and slashing mechanisms provide the final piece of oracle accountability. When conflicting data
submissions occur, the protocol doesn’t defer to authority but to evidence. Cryptographic proofs, timestamped documents,
and third-party attestations determine truth. Initial markets are selected for their combination of tech-forward
populations, transparent public records, and significant transaction volume—each serving as a proving ground for the
oracle ecosystem.
