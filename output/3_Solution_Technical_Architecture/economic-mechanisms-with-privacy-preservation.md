# Economic Mechanisms with Privacy Preservation

The protocol's economic design recognizes a fundamental tension:
transparency enables efficiency but privacy preserves negotiating power.
Our zero-knowledge proof implementation resolves this paradox, allowing
selective disclosure of property attributes without revealing complete
records. A buyer can prove they qualify for a mortgage without exposing
their full financial history. A seller can demonstrate clear title
without publishing their ownership timeline.

Off-chain privacy with on-chain verification creates the best of both
worlds. Sensitive documents remain encrypted in distributed storage,
accessible only to authorized parties. Yet the cryptographic proofs of
these documents---their existence, validity, and key attributes---live
immutably on-chain. This architecture reduces technology infrastructure
costs from \$4,180 to \$1,580 per transaction while actually enhancing
both privacy and verifiability.

The comprehensive audit framework ensures system integrity without
compromising user autonomy. Every transaction generates an immutable
audit trail, every oracle validation creates a permanent record, every
smart contract execution logs its parameters. Yet these logs reveal only
what participants choose to disclose, maintaining the confidentiality
essential to negotiated transactions while providing the transparency
required for trust.
