# Solution Architecture & Key Innovations

Where legacy systems optimize for extraction, Elephant architects for
efficiency. Where gatekeepers profit from opacity, our protocols create
transparency. Where redundancy generates revenue, our networks reward
permanence. The transformation from \$67,532 to \$8,165 per transaction
emerges not from marginal improvements but from fundamental
reconstruction---a deliberate assembly of cryptographic primitives,
economic mechanisms, and technological innovations that create value
rather than extract it.
