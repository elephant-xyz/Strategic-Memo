\section{Layer Synchronization with Cost Disaggregation}

Traditional real estate transactions bundle costs in ways that obscure value and prevent competition. The Elephant protocol disaggregates these bundles into atomic services, each priced according to actual computational and human resources required. This three-layer architecture—blockchain primitives at the base, oracle consensus in the middle, application interfaces at the top—creates clear separation of concerns that enables radical efficiency gains.

The micro-task implementation transforms the \$40{,}100 labor cost burden into \$4{,}235 of targeted professional services. Rather than paying agents \$15{,}000 for bundled services regardless of need, consumers access specific expertise: \$200 for neighborhood analysis, \$300 for negotiation support, \$150 for document review. This granular pricing aligns cost with value, eliminating the cross-subsidization that inflates transaction expenses.

Token-based compensation ensures market fairness while enabling global talent participation. The protocol's payment rails handle currency conversion, reputation tracking, and escrow automatically. This creates a liquid market for real estate services where quality and efficiency drive selection rather than geographic proximity or institutional affiliation. Oracle validators can operate from anywhere, bringing specialized expertise to any market without physical presence requirements.
