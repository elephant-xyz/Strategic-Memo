The Elephant protocol creates the first real estate market where reputation is objective, portable, and valuable. Every
professional interaction generates cryptographically signed outcomes that build immutable performance histories. This
transforms how markets evaluate and reward quality, creating evolutionary pressure toward excellence.

Performance-based compensation becomes standard when results are verifiable. Natural quality improvements emerge from
transparency without regulatory enforcement. When professionals know their performance becomes permanent public record,
behavior changes. Market forces accomplish what regulations struggle to enforce---consistent, high-quality service.
