# Solution Principles

The path forward demands recognizing that centralization is the problem
and decentralization is the solution. Real estate data must anchor on
blockchain rails as public infrastructure, accessible to all rather than
hoarded by gatekeepers. Property records---ownership, mortgages, liens,
appraisals, permits---become independent but interoperable data layers,
each verifiable without redundant work. Cryptographic attestations from
staked providers replace trust in institutions with trust in
mathematics.

This isn't incremental reform but systematic replacement. Where the
current system profits from forgetting, we create permanent memory.
Where gatekeepers control access, we enable permissionless
participation. Where opacity enables extraction, we enforce
transparency. Where misaligned incentives corrupt outcomes, we align
rewards with value creation. The solution doesn't negotiate with the
problem---it obsoletes it entirely.

Industry memory will capture every transaction, upgrade, and service
interaction permanently. Shared data access will slash verification
costs while opening capital markets. Privacy-preserving cryptography
will protect sensitive information while enabling necessary
verification. Staking and slashing mechanisms will ensure data quality.
The invisible hand of the market will finally operate, freed from the
visible fist of gatekeeping. Real estate will transform from humanity's
most inefficient market into its most transparent, serving the needs of
owners rather than the greed of intermediaries.
