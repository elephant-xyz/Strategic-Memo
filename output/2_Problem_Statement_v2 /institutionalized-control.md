# Institutionalized Control

Centralized gatekeepers don't merely profit from the current
system---they actively defend it through regulatory capture and
competitive restriction. The National Association of Realtors enforces
price collusion through \"ethics\" rules that punish discount brokers.
State licensing boards mandate hundreds of hours of \"continuing
education\" that teaches nothing about modern technology or efficient
processes. Mortgage companies engage in explicit competitive
restriction, as seen in the Rocket Mortgage versus UWM battles over
exclusive broker relationships.

These institutions block open competition through legal and quasi-legal
mechanisms. They lobby for regulations that entrench manual processes.
They sue technology companies that threaten their gatekeeping. They
create professional guilds that exclude innovators while protecting
incompetence. The system isn't broken---it works exactly as designed,
extracting maximum value while providing minimum service, protected by
regulatory moats that took decades to dig.
