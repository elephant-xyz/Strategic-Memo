# Resulting Housing Unaffordability

Natural competitive market forces cannot operate when competition is
systematically suppressed and true costs are expertly concealed.
Transaction fees compound across multiple refinancing cycles and holding
periods, creating lifetime extraction that dwarfs the original home
price. A family owning a home for seven years pays \$9,594 annually just
in transaction costs---a hidden tax on the American Dream that enriches
intermediaries while impoverishing households.

The macroeconomic impact ripples through society. When transaction costs
consume 16.3% of property value, labor mobility freezes---workers can't
afford to relocate for better opportunities. Families delay downsizing
or upsizing, living in suboptimal housing because moving costs too much.
Young buyers are priced out entirely, not by home values but by
transaction friction. Wealth accumulation stalls as equity evaporates
into fees. The entire economy suffers from misallocated resources,
reduced productivity, and decreased dynamism.
