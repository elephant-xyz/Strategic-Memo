# Institutionalized Rent-Seeking

The genius of real estate extraction lies in its careful design to
minimize perceived pain while maximizing actual cost. Sellers pay agent
commissions \"off the top\" from proceeds, making the expense feel less
acute than writing a check. Buyers unknowingly finance mortgage broker
commissions through rate markups, transforming \$3,708 in upfront fees
into \$9,421 in additional interest---a 2.5x multiplier hidden in
monthly payments. Lenders employ the same mechanism, converting their
fees into rate increases that extract value for thirty years.

These embedded costs represent 42% of total transaction expenses, yet
remain invisible to most consumers. A borrower comparing mortgage rates
sees numbers like 6.5% versus 7%, not understanding that the difference
represents tens of thousands in hidden commissions compounded over
decades. The industry deliberately obscures true costs through
complexity, spreading extraction across time to avoid triggering
consumer resistance. It's predation perfected---the prey doesn't even
feel the bite.
