# Misaligned Incentives and Principal-Agent

Service providers in real estate have perfected the art of necessary
inefficiency. Their incentives align not toward streamlining
transactions but toward ensuring their permanent involvement. Why create
systems that remember when forgetting generates \$8,600 per transaction?
Why enable direct communication when coordination failures justify
commission? Why reduce friction when friction is the product?

This misalignment manifests most perniciously in pricing structures tied
to asset values rather than actual work. Agent fees scale with home
prices---a \$2 million property pays ten times the commission of a
\$200,000 home despite requiring identical effort. This percentage-based
extraction creates powerful incentives to inflate asset prices, driving
the very unaffordability that locks millions out of homeownership. The
system profits from scarcity, complexity, and inflated
values---precisely the opposite of what society needs.

Reputation tracking remains deliberately absent, allowing low-quality
providers to operate indefinitely. The inspector who misses critical
issues faces no market consequences. The agent who provides terrible
service maintains equal standing with excellence. Without persistent
performance data, every transaction becomes a gamble on provider
quality. Bad actors don't just survive---they thrive in the shadows of
information asymmetry, protected by the same opacity that enables
systemic extraction.
