# Abstract

American real estate transactions cost $234.8 billion annually—not to
build homes or improve properties, but to repeatedly verify the same
information, coordinate between incompatible systems, and pay
gatekeepers for accessing what should be public data. On a typical
$412,000 home purchase, buyers and sellers pay $67,155 in transaction
costs, with 42% hidden in mortgage rate manipulations that transform
one-time broker fees into decades of excess interest.[1] Most
perversely, these costs scale with property values rather than actual
work performed, creating a system where million-dollar transactions cost
five times more than $200,000 ones despite requiring identical effort.

The Elephant protocol replaces this extractive architecture with
transparent infrastructure that reduces transaction costs by 89%. By
treating real estate data as public infrastructure on blockchain rails,
tokenizing properties as permanent digital assets, and automating
coordination through smart contracts, we eliminate the systematic
inefficiencies that have plagued property transactions for centuries.

This transformation extends beyond economics to fundamental market
restructuring. When transaction costs drop from 16.3% to 1.7% of
property value, fractional ownership becomes viable, international
investment barriers dissolve, and previously excluded communities gain
market access. Properties become liquid assets with 72-hour closings
instead of 45-day ordeals. Real estate professionals evolve from
gatekeepers to value creators, competing on service quality rather than
information monopolies. Zero-knowledge proofs enable mathematical trust
without sacrificing privacy, ensuring verified transactions that protect
sensitive information.

Deployment begins in 2025 across three strategic pilot markets,
leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure for immediate scalability.
By 2030, we project 50% market share as network effects compound and
traditional players either adapt or obsolete. The Elephant protocol
doesn’t just digitize existing processes—it reimagines property rights
for the digital age, creating programmable, divisible, verifiable
ownership that serves humanity rather than intermediaries.

is calculated and why rate-embedded commissions create a lifetime tax on
borrowers.
