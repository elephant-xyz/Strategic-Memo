American real estate transactions cost $234.8 billion annuallynot to build homes or improve properties, but to repeatedly verify the same information, coordinate between incompatible systems, and pay gatekeepers for accessing what should be public data. On a typical $412,000 home purchase, buyers and sellers pay $67,155 in transaction costs, with 42% hidden in mortgage rate manipulations that transform one. time broker fees into decades of excess interest.¹ Most perversely, these costs scale with property values rather than actual work performed, creating a system where million. dollar transactions cost five times more than $200,000 ones despite requiring identical effort.

| The Elephant protocol replaces this extractive architecture with transparent infrastructure that reduces transaction costs by 89%. By treating real estate data as public infrastructure on blockchain rails, tokenizing properties as permanent digital assets, and automating coordination through smart contracts, we eliminate the systematic inefficiencies that have plagued property transactions for centuries. | **Transaction Costs, $** | | | | |

When transaction costs drop from 16.3% to 1.7% of property value, fractional ownership becomes viable, international investment barriers dissolve, and previously excluded communities gain market access. Properties become liquid assets with 72-hour closings instead of 45-day ordeals. Real estate professionals evolve from gatekeepers to value creators, competing on service quality rather than information monopolies. Zero. knowledge proofs enable mathematical trust without sacrificing privacy, ensuring verified transactions that protect sensitive information. |

Deployment begins in 2025 across three strategic pilot markets, leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure for immediate scalability. By 2030, we project 50% market share as network effects compound and traditional players either adapt or obsolete. The Elephant protocol doesnt just digitize existing processesit reimagines property rights for the digital age, creating programmable, divisible, verifiable ownership that serves humanity rather than intermediaries.
