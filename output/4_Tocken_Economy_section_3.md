Beyond initial verification, the protocol must ensure data remains current and accurate over time, which requires continuous economic incentives for ongoing maintenance. Oracles are responsible for keeping their data groups current at all times. Live data integrity is enforced through responsiveness and continuous re-verification, with economic incentives that reward active maintenance while penalizing neglect. Only oracles who currently hold vMAHOUT receive gas fees and ad revenue, creating a direct incentive for continuous data maintenance.

vMAHOUT is reassigned if a fresher, validated data submission is made, ensuring that only the oracle maintaining the freshest truth receives rewards. vMAHOUT decays weekly by 1% if the oracle becomes inactive, eventually approaching zero for those who abandon their responsibilities. Eligibility for rewards depends entirely on maintaining vMAHOUT through active data stewardship.

This ongoing accountability ensures that the networkâ€™s truth layer remains reliable over time. When data becomes stale or incorrect, the oracle loses both governance power and economic rewards, aligning individual incentives with network reliability. The system rewards oracles who maintain accurate, current data while creating natural pressure for those who let their contributions deteriorate.
