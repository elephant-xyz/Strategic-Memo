\## Service Provider Economics: Competing on Merit Real estate
professionals face a fundamental shift in the Elephant economy: from
gatekeeping to genuine service competition. The protocol automatically
generates SEO-optimized fact sheets for every verified property,
designed to rank highly in search results and attract millions of
property researchers. These fact sheets become premium advertising real
estate where professionals compete for visibility. (See Section 6.2 for
detailed explanation of why Elephant fact sheets naturally achieve
superior search rankings through verified data, structured markup, and
continuous updates.)

Service providers—agents, lenders, inspectors, attorneys—stake MAHOUT
tokens to secure advertising positions on relevant fact sheets. Higher
stakes win more prominent placement, creating a pure market for
attention. But unlike traditional advertising where money alone
determines position, the Elephant protocol incorporates performance
metrics. Service providers who generate positive outcomes maintain their
positions with lower stakes, while those with poor reviews require
increasingly higher stakes to remain visible.

This staking mechanism generates continuous demand for MAHOUT tokens
while funding the oracles who maintain the underlying data. A portion of
all staking fees flows back to the oracles responsible for each
property’s fact groups, creating recursive incentives for data quality.
Better data attracts more users, driving more advertising value,
increasing staking competition, rewarding better oracles, who create
better data.
