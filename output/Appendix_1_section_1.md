\## The Problem: Misaligned Incentives in Web3 Funding Traditional
venture capital corrupts Web3’s decentralization ethos from inception.
Founders sacrifice 20-40% equity to investors who demand liquidity
events, board control, and preferential terms that prioritize financial
returns over protocol health. This misalignment manifests in token
launches designed for speculation rather than utility, creating
boom-bust cycles that destroy user trust and regulatory credibility.

ICOs promised democratized funding but delivered chaos. Without skin in
the game, projects raised millions on whitepapers alone, creating
perverse incentives to maximize fundraising rather than build functional
products. The 2017-2018 ICO boom left a graveyard of failed projects,
regulatory scrutiny, and investor losses exceeding $15 billion. Even
successful ICOs struggled with token economics that rewarded early
speculation over long-term contribution.

DeFi yield farming evolved the model but retained fundamental flaws.
Protocols bootstrap liquidity through inflationary rewards that attract
mercenary capital, creating unsustainable spirals where new token
emissions fund previous participants. This Ponzi-like structure ensures
eventual collapse when emissions slow or market conditions change. Real
utility becomes secondary to yield optimization games.

Bitcoin holders, controlling over $1.2 trillion in digital gold, lack
structured mechanisms to support ecosystem development. They face a
binary choice: hold Bitcoin and miss innovation opportunities, or sell
Bitcoin and lose exposure to the hardest money ever created. This forces
the most philosophically aligned capital to remain sidelined while Web3
development depends on fiat-minded venture capitalists.

The current paradigm creates recursive failure: projects need capital
but sacrifice principles to get it, investors demand returns that
corrupt protocol design, users suffer from misaligned incentives, and
regulators react to obvious manipulation. Breaking this cycle requires
rethinking fundraising from first principles—treating capital formation
as a protocol design problem rather than a legal structuring exercise.
