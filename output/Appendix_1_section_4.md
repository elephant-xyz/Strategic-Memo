Bitstrapping creates incentive cascades where individual optimization leads to
collective benefit. Unlike zero-sum equity models where founder dilution equals
investor gain, or inflationary token models where early participants extract
from later ones, Bitstrapping ensures all parties profit from protocol success.

Bitcoin holders gain leveraged exposure to protocol upside while maintaining
Bitcoin holdings. Consider the mathematics: a 1 BTC contribution might yield
tokens worth 2-3 BTC if the protocol succeeds, plus stablecoin repayment, while
the original Bitcoin remains locked but owned. This creates attractive
risk-reward dynamics:

$$\text{Expected Return} = \frac{\text{Token Value} + \text{Repayment} + \text{BTC Value}}{\text{BTC Contributed}} - 1$$

With typical parameters, expected returns range from 2-3x for successful
protocols while downside remains limited to foregone Bitcoin appreciation during
the lock period.

Protocol teams access non-dilutive funding that aligns with long-term building.
No quarterly board meetings demanding growth at any cost. No liquidation
preferences corrupting exit decisions. No venture partners pushing premature
token launches. Just patient capital expecting reasonable returns through
stablecoin repayment while teams focus on product development.

Token economics become sustainable when separated from fundraising. Tokens
represent actual utility rather than fundraising vehicles, preventing the
boom-bust cycles plaguing current models. Natural demand from protocol usage
supports token value rather than speculation or yield farming. This creates
virtuous cycles where adoption drives value drives adoption.

Repayment obligations create accountability without extractive terms. Protocols
must generate real revenue or preserve capital to meet obligations, enforcing
the financial discipline often lacking in crypto projects. Yet fixed repayment
amounts mean protocols capture upside beyond obligations, incentivizing
ambitious building rather than conservative management.
