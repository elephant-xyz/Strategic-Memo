Mathematical guarantees replace institutional dependencies throughout the property ecosystem. Cryptographic proofs eliminate the need for repeated verification. Smart contracts ensure consistent rule application without human discretion. Immutable records prevent historical revisionism. Automated execution removes opportunities for discrimination. Verifiable credentials preserve privacy while ensuring transparency.

This transformation from human trust to mathematical trust doesn't just reduce costs---it fundamentally restructures power relationships in real estate. When verification depends on mathematics rather than relationships, everyone gets equal treatment. When records can't be altered or lost, property rights become truly secure. When processes execute automatically, corruption becomes impossible.
