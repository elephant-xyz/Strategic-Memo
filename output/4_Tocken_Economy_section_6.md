The protocol creates value beyond token economics through SEO-optimized property fact sheets. Every verified property
automatically generates a comprehensive, search-engine-friendly page containing all verified data. These pages, backed
by blockchain verification and continuously updated by oracles, naturally outrank marketing-focused property listings in
search results.

This creates an organic traffic flywheel that drives the entire economy. Property researchers find Elephant fact sheets
through Google, discover comprehensive verified data, and encounter service provider advertisements. Service providers
compete through staking for these valuable positions. Their stakes fund oracles who improve data quality. Better data
improves search rankings. Higher rankings drive more traffic. More traffic increases ad values. The cycle compounds.
Advertising is permissionless; those who stake more tokens gain better placement, while staking flows back to the data
validators.
