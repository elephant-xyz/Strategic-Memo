The operational challenges created by margin bloat compound through leadership backgrounds that emphasize relationships over systems. Industry leadership typically emerges from sales or finance backgrounds, with operational instincts that rely on hiring and firing as primary levers rather than systematic process improvement.

This creates systematic underinvestment in technology and process innovation. Technology integration remains poor because organizational structures don’t support it—sales-driven cultures prioritize immediate revenue over long-term systems building, while finance-driven cultures focus on cost management or capital markets optimizations rather than value creation through core product improvement. The result is persistent technology debt and operational inefficiencies that compound over time, making innovation attempts more expensive and less likely to succeed.

The failures of technology-enabled companies like Compass, Better, and Opendoor have reinforced industry resistance to innovation rather than prompting reflection on implementation approaches. These companies achieved what might be called the worst of both worlds: traditional inefficiencies combined with technological complexity, regulatory burden combined with operational inexperience, and venture capital burn rates combined with analog profit margins. Their failures validated existing industry beliefs that technology cannot improve real estate economics, despite evidence that they failed due to scaling traditional business models rather than creating genuinely new approaches.
