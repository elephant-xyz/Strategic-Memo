Bitstrapping integrates seamlessly with protocol design without compromising
core functionality. The funding mechanism exists as a separate layer,
interacting with but not dependent on protocol operations. This separation
ensures fundraising doesn't distort technical architecture or governance
structures---a critical flaw in many token-based systems.

For Elephant specifically, the integration follows clear boundaries. Bitcoin
holders lock BTC in a dedicated smart contract for 3 years, receiving MAHOUT
tokens from the DAO treasury allocation at a 30% discount to projected utility
value. Since MAHOUT tokens are primarily mined by oracles through Proof of
Truth, the DAO allocates a portion of its 30% treasury share for Bitstrapping
participants. Elephant commits to repay 15% of locked Bitcoin value in
stablecoins at maturity. MAHOUT tokens provide concrete utility: 50% transaction
fee discounts, governance rights proportional to holdings, priority oracle
assignment access, and shares of protocol revenue exceeding operational costs.

The smart contract architecture ensures trustless execution through
cryptographic commitments:

- Time-locked Bitcoin remains verifiable on-chain, providing transparency and
preventing protocol malfeasance

- Token minting follows predetermined curves based on Bitcoin contributions,
preventing dilution or favoritism

- Repayment obligations are hard-coded and auditable, creating credible
commitments

- Governance remains separate from fundraising, preventing capture by large
Bitcoin contributors

Integration points remain minimal and explicit. The Bitstrapping contract
interacts with the protocol only to mint tokens according to contribution rules.
It doesn't affect oracle operations, data verification processes, or service
provider dynamics. This modularity ensures the funding mechanism enhances rather
than complicates protocol development.

Long-term sustainability emerges from aligned incentives rather than enforced
rules. Bitcoin contributors want the protocol to succeed to maximize token
utility value. The protocol wants to succeed to easily meet repayment
obligations from revenues. Users benefit from better-funded infrastructure.
Everyone wins when the protocol creates real value---a stark contrast to the
zero-sum games of traditional venture funding.
