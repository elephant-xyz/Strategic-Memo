While many real estate platforms claim blockchain innovation, most fall short of its foundational ideals. As outlined by Andreas M. Antonopoulos in *The Internet of Money*, a true blockchain system should deliver decentralization, trustless validation, permissionless access, user sovereignty, and elimination of intermediaries.

Most solutions merely bolt blockchain onto legacy systems, preserving traditional power structures. This evaluation highlights key projects based on core decentralization principles:

| **Project** | **Decentralization** | **Trustless Validation** | **Permissionless Access** | **Middleman Elimination** | **Alignment** |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Elephant Protocol** |  Full oracle network with staking & slashing |  Cryptographic proofs, immutable record |  Anyone can verify/earn |  Removes $234B in friction | <span style="color: green">**Fully aligned**</span> |
| **Propy** |  Hybrid: relies on agents |  Blockchain for record, not truth |  Requires agent approval |  Brokers, title, escrow intact | <span style="color: orange">**Partially aligned**</span> |
| **RealT** |  Ethereum token layer only |  Blockchain for token, not legal trust |  Walled garden (KYC/AML) |  Third-party managed assets | <span style="color: red">**Not aligned**</span> |
| **Lofty.ai** |  Algorand-based tokens |  Partial automation only |  Platform access only |  Centralized asset control | <span style="color: red">**Not aligned**</span> |
| **Landshare** |  BSC-based tokenization |  Staking for DeFi, not property |  Controlled via dApp |  Traditional ownership retained | <span style="color: red">**Not aligned**</span> |

Comparison of Real Estate Blockchain Projects Against Decentralized Design Principles

Only Elephant Protocol fully embraces decentralization: eliminating intermediaries, enabling trustless validation, and granting open access to all participants. Other projects maintain dependency on agents, centralized controls, or regulatory gateways that contradict the ethos of user sovereignty.

This distinction matters. Tokenization alone doesn’t disrupt real estate’s structural inefficiencies. To unlock blockchain’s true impact, platforms must be decentralized by design—not merely in branding.

Elephant Protocol demonstrates how blockchain can genuinely replace traditional infrastructure, not reinforce it. Its architecture shows that meaningful transformation is possible when systems are built from first principles rather than retrofitted for optics.
