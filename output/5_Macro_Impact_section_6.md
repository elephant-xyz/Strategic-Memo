Consumers save \$60,010 per transaction---over one year of pre-tax income returned to families. Service providers gain
efficiency-based competition opportunities where merit determines success. Communities gain expanded ownership access,
with first-generation and underserved populations benefiting most from reduced barriers.

Primary losses concentrate among those extracting value without creating it: part-time or low-quality service providers,
those overcharging for commodity services, those profiting from hidden fees, licensing bodies that gate-keep rather than
ensure quality, and professional organizations like MLS and NAR that maintain artificial scarcity. The market naturally
selects against extraction in favor of value creation, transforming real estate from a cartel-protected industry to a
competitive market serving human needs.
