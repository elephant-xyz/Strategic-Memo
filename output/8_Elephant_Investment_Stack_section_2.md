vMAHOUT tokens serve dual functions as governance instruments and gas rights certificates, earned exclusively by oracles maintaining the freshest data for specific property groups. This design ensures decision-making authority flows to active network contributors rather than passive token holders, while creating sustainable revenue streams tied directly to network utility.

The economic model distributes gas fee revenue across three distinct market segments. Data oracles maintaining property records capture \$2.5 billion annually from verification services, data updates, and consensus operations. Technology providers building infrastructure tools and APIs access \$3.5 billion from development services, integration support, and platform maintenance. Service providers delivering consumer-facing applications earn from \$16.4 billion in transaction fees across lending, title, escrow, and advisory services.

Combined, these streams create a \$22.3 billion annual total addressable market available to vMAHOUT holders, excluding fees retained by protocol governance, AI agents, and Layer 2 operations. The revenue model applies conservative 5$\times$ sales multiples standard for recurring technology infrastructure, yielding total value potential of:
$$\text{vMAHOUT Value} = (\$3.5 \text{ billion} + \$2.5 \text{ billion}) \times 5 = \$30.0 \text{ billion}$$

This valuation methodology reflects established market pricing for predictable, growing revenue streams in data infrastructure sectors. The multiple accounts for recurring gas fee revenue that expands with network adoption, transaction volume growth, and increasing maintenance requirements as the protocol scales globally. Service provider fees remain excluded as they fall outside the scope of blockchain and technology infrastructure investments.
