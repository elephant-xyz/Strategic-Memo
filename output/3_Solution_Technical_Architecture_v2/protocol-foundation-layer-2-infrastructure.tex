\section{Protocol Foundation: Layer 2 Infrastructure}

Elephant's architectural foundation rests on proven Layer 2 technology, initially deploying on Polygon for its optimal balance of scalability, cost efficiency, and ecosystem maturity. This decision reflects our commitment to immediate market impact rather than theoretical perfection. While early releases accept single-chain limitations, the architecture anticipates multi-chain interoperability and cross-layer bridging as natural evolution points.

The protocol leverages decentralized storage through IPFS, with providers like Pinata ensuring fast, resilient, and censorship-resistant data availability. This hybrid approach anchors cryptographic proofs on-chain while storing property data payloads off-chain, achieving both auditability and economic efficiency. Every property record maintains its complete history through immutable on-chain references to evolving off-chain data structures.

This foundation transforms the current \$3,820 per-transaction technology cost into an \$850 integrated systemâ€”a 78\% reduction achieved through architectural coherence rather than piecemeal optimization. Where traditional systems require 17 separate applications with zero interoperability, Elephant provides a unified data layer that all applications can trust and build upon.
