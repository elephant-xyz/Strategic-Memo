# Privacy Architecture & Data Sensitivity Phasing

Elephant approaches privacy through careful phasing that builds trust
while respecting sensitivity. Phase 1 focuses exclusively on public data
sources---county records, assessor data, and public title information.
No private borrower or identity data is collected in initial stages,
allowing the protocol to prove its value with non-controversial
information before handling more sensitive data.

Phase 2 will introduce privacy-preserving designs for sensitive
financial data such as mortgage pre-approvals, income verification, and
underwriting. The protocol will apply identity-less cryptographic
primitives and selective disclosure mechanisms, ensuring that private
data can be verified without being exposed. Zero-knowledge proofs and
decentralized identity frameworks will enable compliant borrower-side
data handling while maintaining individual privacy.

This phased approach acknowledges that trust must be earned, not
assumed. By starting with public data and demonstrating value, Elephant
creates the foundation for handling increasingly sensitive information.
The architecture anticipates these future requirements without
over-engineering current solutions, maintaining development velocity
while ensuring long-term viability.
