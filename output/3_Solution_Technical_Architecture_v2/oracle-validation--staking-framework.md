# Oracle Validation & Staking Framework

Truth enters the Elephant network through a sophisticated oracle
validation system that balances decentralization with data quality. The
protocol collects property data from multiple independent oracle
providers, each required to submit off-chain cryptographic signatures
for all data contributions. These submissions are aggregated into Merkle
proofs for efficient on-chain commitment, creating an audit trail that
proves consensus without storing redundant data.

The staking framework functions as live economic attestation, where
oracles put capital at risk to vouch for their data quality. This
creates escalating confidence layers---data verified by more oracles
with higher stakes carries greater trust weight. Unlike traditional
systems where reputation is subjective and localized, Elephant creates
objective, transferable credibility that follows oracles across
jurisdictions and time.

The economic model transforms verification from a cost center into a
profit center for accurate participants. Where traditional systems pay
\$2,500 per transaction for data verification that evaporates upon
completion, Elephant invests \$250 in permanent verification that
appreciates over time. This 90% reduction in verification costs comes
not from cutting corners but from aligning incentives with outcomes.
