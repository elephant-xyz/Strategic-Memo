\chapter{Solution Architecture \& Key Innovations}

The Elephant protocol deploys on Polygon's Layer 2 infrastructure to achieve immediate scalability while maintaining sub-cent transaction costs essential for high-volume property data operations. This technical architecture combines on-chain verification with off-chain storage through IPFS, creating a hybrid system that balances immutability with economic efficiency. Rather than building another blockchain from scratch, we leverage proven infrastructure to focus engineering resources on the core challenge: creating a unified data layer that transforms fragmented property information into composable, verifiable digital assets.
