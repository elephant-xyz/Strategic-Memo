# Lexicon Data Model

The Lexicon represents Elephant's answer to decades of data
fragmentation in real estate. Rather than accepting the industry's babel
of incompatible standards, formats, and schemas, the protocol introduces
a unified data model that captures the full complexity of property
ownership while maintaining computational efficiency. This isn't merely
a technical achievement---it's a philosophical statement about how
property information should flow through society.

The model handles ownership chains, liens, mortgages, permits, and
upgrades within a single coherent structure. Properties are not simple
objects but complex entities with relationships, histories, and futures.
The Lexicon captures these dimensions while remaining queryable,
updatable, and verifiable. It powers consistent cross-jurisdictional
data interoperability, enabling a property in New York to be understood
by systems in California without translation layers.

By modeling real estate lifecycle representation as a first-class
concern, the Lexicon enables queries that are impossible in traditional
systems. Questions like \"Show all properties owned by Entity X since
1995\" or \"What is the average holding period in this ZIP code\" become
trivial rather than requiring weeks of manual research. This transforms
real estate from an opaque market into a transparent one where
information asymmetry cannot sustain extractive business models.
