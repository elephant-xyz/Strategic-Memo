\section{Smart Contract Governance}

Elephant's smart contracts enforce closed-loop governance on data minting, staking, dispute resolution, and economic incentives. Rather than relying on legal contracts interpreted by humans, the protocol embeds its rules directly into code that executes automatically and impartially. This eliminates the coordination overhead that currently costs thousands per transaction while ensuring consistent rule application across all participants.

The governance system controls permissioned data minting and record issuance, ensuring that only verified data from consensus-validated oracles can create official property records. Automated dispute resolution and data correction workflows replace the current system where errors can persist for years, hidden in filing cabinets or proprietary databases. The contracts support upgradeable logic, allowing protocol evolution without disrupting existing records or relationships.

Oracle participation rules embedded in smart contracts create a meritocratic marketplace for truth verification. Data providers stake MAHOUT tokens against their submissions, with slashing penalties applied for malicious or inaccurate data post-minting. This economic alignment ensures that participants profit from accuracy rather than obfuscation, reversing the current system's perverse incentives.
