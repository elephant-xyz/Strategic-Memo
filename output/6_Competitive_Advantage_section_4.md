Perhaps most fundamentally, the industry suffers from systematic confusion about customer identity that prevents even well-intentioned participants from serving transacting parties effectively. While the true customer—the buyer, seller, or borrower— bears the costs of real estate transactions, the industry’s economic structure ensures that agents function as the *de facto* customer since the agent largely controls the transactional flow and selection of service providers. This creates perverse incentives that flow through every aspect of the transaction process and a systematic underservicing of the paying customer.
