Now that we have established the technical foundation for decentralized property verification, sustainable operation requires economic incentives that align oracle behavior with network integrity. Without proper incentives, even the most sophisticated verification systems fail when participants lack motivation to contribute accurate data or maintain network quality over time. This economic design challenge becomes particularly complex in real estate, where data verification involves both objective facts that can be independently confirmed and subjective assessments that require reputation and specialized knowledge.

MAHOUT is the protocol’s native currency—a language of value that bootstraps the network by incentivizing oracles to submit verified property data across 20 fact groups. vMAHOUT is a non-transferable governance and gas-fee rights token that grants ongoing economic participation and decision-making power to oracles maintaining the freshest data. Together, these tokens create an economy where truth pays better than lies, contribution earns more than extraction, and governance flows to those who build rather than those who buy.

The purpose of MAHOUT issuance is to accelerate the creation of data density, catalyzing the network flywheel during the bootstrapping phase. Network operations are funded through gas fees paid in MAHOUT, while vMAHOUT serves as the access key for earning these shared rewards among active oracles. After MAHOUT issuance ends, vMAHOUT becomes the sole access key to protocol rewards, aligning long-term incentives with protocol integrity and participation. This dual-token structure transforms real estate’s current extraction paradigm into a contribution paradigm where participants profit from reducing friction rather than creating it.
