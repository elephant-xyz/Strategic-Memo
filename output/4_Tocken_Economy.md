MAHOUT is the protocol’s native currency—a language of value that bootstraps the network by incentivizing oracles to submit verified property data across 20 fact groups. vMAHOUT is a non-transferable governance and gas-fee rights token that grants ongoing economic participation and decision-making power to oracles maintaining the freshest data. Together, these tokens create an economy where truth pays better than lies, contribution earns more than extraction, and governance flows to those who build rather than those who buy.

The purpose of MAHOUT issuance is to accelerate the creation of data density, catalyzing the network flywheel during the bootstrapping phase. After MAHOUT issuance ends, vMAHOUT becomes the sole access key to protocol rewards, aligning long-term incentives with protocol integrity and participation. This dual-token structure transforms real estate’s current extraction paradigm into a contribution paradigm where participants profit from reducing friction rather than creating it.
