\## Monetization Engine

Beyond truth verification rewards, the protocol creates sustainable
economics through its fact sheet monetization engine. Every verified
property automatically generates a public-facing fact sheet containing
comprehensive, verified information about the property. These fact
sheets are optimized for search engine indexing, creating valuable
digital real estate that attracts millions of property researchers
monthly.

Real estate professionals can advertise on these fact sheets by staking
MAHOUT tokens. The staking mechanism creates a competitive marketplace
where higher stakes secure better ad placement. This generates a
continuous revenue stream that flows back to the oracles maintaining the
underlying data, creating a virtuous cycle where data quality directly
drives monetization potential.

The advertising model transforms the current $15.5 billion spent
annually on fragmented real estate technology into a unified, efficient
marketplace. By providing verified data as the foundation, the protocol
ensures that advertising appears alongside trustworthy information,
increasing its value to both advertisers and consumers.
