Every real estate transaction conducted through the Elephant platform generates native fees that sustain the ecosystem
without extracting value. These fees, totaling approximately \$700 per transaction, fund both oracle rewards and DAO
operational costs. Compared to the current \$67,155 average transaction cost, this represents a 99% reduction in direct
transaction fees while still maintaining robust economics for all participants.

The fee structure breaks down into specific allocations: oracle rewards for maintaining property data, DAO treasury for
development and operations, and system maintenance including gas cost subsidies. This transparent allocation ensures
every dollar serves a specific purpose rather than disappearing into opaque \"processing\" or \"administrative\" fees.
Transaction fees also create natural token demand as they must be paid in MAHOUT, establishing a consumption mechanism
that balances token emission from oracle rewards.
