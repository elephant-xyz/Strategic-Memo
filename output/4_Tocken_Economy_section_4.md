The broader economic ecosystem requires mechanisms that connect data quality to network utility and revenue generation, which the staking system accomplishes through natural unlock mechanics and continuous value flow. Earned MAHOUT tokens remain locked until two conditions are met: the oracle holds vMAHOUT and a service provider stakes advertisements on that Fact Sheet. This creates natural unlock mechanics tied to network utility rather than arbitrary time locks, ensuring that token releases correlate with actual network value creation.

Service providers must stake MAHOUT tokens to advertise on the platform, with competitive ad placement prioritized by stake size. Initially, this advertising consists of simple phone number listings on property fact sheets—when consumers discover verified properties, they can directly contact listed service providers. Each day, 1% of each provider’s ad stake is slashed and redirected to the maintaining oracle, ensuring continuous incentives for data freshness. This daily slash mechanism creates continuous demand for MAHOUT while funding the oracles who maintain data quality.

The advertising model provides service providers with high-quality, targeted exposure at significantly lower costs than traditional lead generation platforms. Unlike broad-based advertising, these placements reach consumers already interested in specific properties, creating higher conversion rates and better ROI for service providers. Over time, this simple phone-based system will evolve into specialized applications for different provider types, but the fundamental economics remain constant.

Fact Sheets consist of 20 validated data groups, optimized for SEO and AI discovery to increase data utility and discoverability. These comprehensive property records become the foundation for organic discovery, with consumers finding verified information through search engines and increasingly through AI assistants. The monetization model transforms property data from a gatekept commodity into a public good that generates revenue through transparent, competitive advertising.

If a property owner assumes the oracle role, the original oracle’s MAHOUT stake is released back to them, ensuring that property owners can always claim control over their own data while compensating previous contributors fairly.
