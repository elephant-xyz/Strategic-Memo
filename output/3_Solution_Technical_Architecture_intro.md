The Elephant protocol deploys on existing Layer 2 chains to achieve immediate scalability while maintaining sub-cent
transaction costs essential for high-volume property data operations. This technical architecture combines on-chain
verification with off-chain storage through IPFS, creating a hybrid system that balances immutability with economic
efficiency. Rather than building another blockchain from scratch, we leverage proven infrastructure to focus engineering
resources on the core challenge: creating a unified data layer that transforms fragmented property information into
composable, verifiable digital assets.

Early design accepts single-chain limitations, with future releases introducing multi-chain interoperability and L2
bridging. Data availability is decentralized using IPFS, leveraging providers like Pinata for fast, resilient, and
censorship-resistant storage. The primary objective is to capture, normalize, and mint the highest quality real estate
data on-chain as fast as possible.
