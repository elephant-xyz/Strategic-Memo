Staircase provides comprehensive exposure across every protocol layer through integrated mining, infrastructure, and application development. The company holds first-mined licenses for 35% of targeted properties while simultaneously building the essential tooling that enables broader network participation. This diversified approach captures value from protocol growth regardless of which specific layer experiences the most rapid expansion.

As the leading infrastructure developer, Staircase acquires additional MAHOUT through creating development frameworks, APIs, and integration tools for ecosystem participants. These infrastructure services generate recurring revenue streams that compound with network growth and adoption. Simultaneously, the company functions as the primary decentralized application creator, building consumer-facing experiences that drive protocol usage, increase transaction volume, and capture value from user engagement.

Future expansion into direct service provision remains strategically viable, with service provider markets representing \$16.4 billion in annual opportunities. However, current priorities focus on foundational infrastructure and comprehensive mining operations that establish network effects and competitive advantages before expanding into direct consumer services.

The integrated exposure ensures Staircase benefits from interconnected value creation across mining, infrastructure, and applications. Success in any layer reinforces returns across other components, providing investors with comprehensive upside participation throughout the ecosystem development process.
