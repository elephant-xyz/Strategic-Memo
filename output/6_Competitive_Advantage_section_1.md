The foundation of the industry’s resistance to change lies in a robust game-theoretic equilibrium where participants maintain tacit coordination around a 6% commission structure without explicit agreements, understanding intuitively that sustained price competition would destroy everyone’s margins without creating sustainable competitive advantages. This coordination emerges naturally from the interdependencies that make each player’s success contingent on maintaining the status quo.

The robustness of this equilibrium became evident after the Sitzer-Burnett class action ruling against the NAR, which legal experts predicted would trigger fundamental fee restructuring. Investment analysts anticipated margin compression. Consumer advocates expected meaningful price relief. Instead, no structural changes occurred, demonstrating that the coordination runs deeper than any single legal intervention. The system’s participants understand that defection from established patterns risks triggering system-wide disruption that would harm everyone.

Mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders are similarly stuck in a game theory trap, embedding compensation in interest rates rather than revealing fees transparently—anyone who attempts transparent pricing to reduce the total cost to the borrower loses business to those who maintain opacity, reinforcing the opaque status quo throughout the industry.
