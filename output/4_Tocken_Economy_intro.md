The Elephant protocol creates an economy where truth pays better than lies, contribution earns more than extraction, and
governance flows to those who build rather than those who buy. Unlike traditional token launches with pre-sales, insider
allocations, and passive speculation, every MAHOUT token must be earned through verified work. This creates a
sustainable ecosystem where value flows to participants who maintain and improve the network's core asset: accurate,
real-time property data. The economic model transforms real estate's current extraction paradigm---where gatekeepers
profit from friction---into a contribution paradigm where participants profit from reducing friction.
