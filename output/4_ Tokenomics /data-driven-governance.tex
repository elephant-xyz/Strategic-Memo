\section{Data-Driven Governance}

Governance power in the Elephant protocol derives from data contribution, not capital deployment. Those who update property records, verify information, and maintain data quality earn vMahout proportional to their contributions. This creates a meritocracy where a dedicated data verifier in rural Kansas can accumulate more governance power than a passive whale in Manhattan. The system rewards work that directly improves network utility rather than mere token accumulation.

Contributors earn from gas fees when their verified data gets accessed, creating sustainable income streams tied to data quality and usage. The more valuable and frequently accessed your contributions, the more you earn and the stronger your governance voice becomes. This feedback loop ensures that those making decisions about the protocol's future are precisely those who understand its day-to-day operations and user needs. It's governance by practitioners rather than speculators---a model that aligns long-term protocol health with individual contributor success.
