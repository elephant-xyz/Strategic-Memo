# vMahout Dynamics

vMahout operates unlike any governance token in the crypto ecosystem.
Non-transferable under normal circumstances, it represents active
participation rather than passive ownership. As oracles verify data,
resolve disputes, and improve the protocol, they accumulate vMahout. But
this power decays without continued contribution---miss verification
cycles, ignore governance proposals, or cease data updates, and your
influence gradually diminishes.

This decay mechanism ensures governance remains with active participants
rather than early adopters who've moved on. However, the protocol
recognizes legitimate succession needs. In cases of retirement,
disability, or death, vMahout can transfer to designated successors who
meet minimum reputation requirements. This preserves institutional
knowledge while preventing governance capture by inactive holders. The
result is a living governance system that adapts to changing
participants while maintaining continuity.

The tokenomics create a virtuous cycle where contributing to the network
directly benefits contributors, quality naturally improves through
competition, and governance aligns with actual usage. This isn't just a
payment system---it's an economic organism that grows stronger through
use, rewards excellence over extraction, and ensures those who build the
future also govern it.
