# Dual-Token Architecture

The Elephant protocol introduces a sophisticated dual-token system that
aligns incentives more precisely than any single-token model could
achieve. Mahout serves as the protocol's economic lifeblood---the
currency that powers transactions, rewards contributions, and measures
value. vMahout represents something more profound: active participation
crystallized into governance power, where influence flows to those who
build and maintain the network rather than those who merely hold tokens.

This separation solves the fundamental tension between speculation and
utility that plagues most crypto protocols. Mahout can flow freely as
currency while vMahout ensures that governance remains with active
contributors. Unlike traditional governance tokens that reward passive
holding, vMahout decays without participation, creating a dynamic where
power naturally gravitates toward those actively improving the network.
This design mirrors how reputation works in the physical world---earned
through consistent contribution, maintained through ongoing engagement,
lost through inactivity.
