\section{Hierarchical Data Valuation}

Not all property data carries equal weight in the Mahout economy. The protocol implements sophisticated data hierarchy where authoritative sources---government registries, official recordings, tax records---earn premium rewards. These foundational data blocks require higher verification standards but provide the bedrock upon which all other data builds. An oracle who successfully verifies and imports official county records earns substantially more than one adding estimated values or property descriptions.

AI-enriched datasets occupy the next tier, where machine learning models process raw data into actionable insights. Oracles who train models to estimate property values, predict maintenance needs, or identify investment opportunities earn enhanced rewards proportional to their models' accuracy and usage. This incentivizes continuous improvement in data quality and analytical capability, transforming static records into dynamic intelligence that grows more valuable over time.
