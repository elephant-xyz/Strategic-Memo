\section{Proof-of-Contribution Rewards}

Beyond mining new Mahout through Proof-of-Truth, the protocol implements Proof-of-Contribution to reward real-world property transaction work. When buyers need homes shown, sellers require marketing, or transactions need inspections, the protocol posts these as tasks. Real estate agents earn Mahout by successfully showing properties and facilitating negotiations. Home inspectors receive rewards for thorough property examinations. Appraisers collect fees for accurate valuations. Each professional contributes their specialized expertise and receives compensation in Mahout proportional to their task's complexity and successful completion.

This transforms traditional real estate work into a transparent, performance-based economy. An agent doesn't earn a flat 3% regardless of effort---they earn based on actual showings conducted, offers negotiated, and deals closed. An inspector's compensation reflects the thoroughness of their examination and accuracy of their reports. The system creates true meritocracy where professionals compete on service quality rather than information gatekeeping. Proof-of-Contribution ensures every Mahout earned represents real value delivered to real people in real transactions.
