# Growth-Aligned Token Creation

Mahout creation directly correlates with real-world network expansion
through property onboarding. As each U.S. property joins the network and
receives its initial data verification, new Mahout enters circulation.
This mechanism ensures token supply growth reflects actual utility
growth rather than arbitrary emission schedules. When the network adds a
thousand properties, it creates proportional token supply to service
those properties' future transactions.

This design creates natural supply-demand equilibrium. More properties
mean more transactions, which require more Mahout for fees and rewards.
The token supply expands precisely when and where needed, preventing
both artificial scarcity and inflationary dilution. As the protocol
expands internationally, each country's property onboarding creates its
own Mahout supply wave, funding local network growth through
programmatic token creation rather than centralized allocation.
