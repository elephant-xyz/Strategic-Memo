# Proof-of-Truth Mining

Mahout enters circulation through a revolutionary Proof-of-Truth
consensus mechanism where oracles mine tokens by establishing verified
facts about properties. Unlike proof-of-work's computational competition
or proof-of-stake's capital requirements, Proof-of-Truth rewards the
discovery and verification of accurate property data. Oracles compete to
be first to verify new information, resolve conflicting records, and
establish canonical truth that the network accepts as fact.

The mining process requires expertise, stake, and reputation. Oracles
must understand property data, invest time in verification, and risk
their reputation on accuracy. When multiple oracles submit data about a
property, the network runs consensus to determine truth. Those who
consistently provide accurate data that achieves consensus earn mining
rewards. Incorrect submissions lead to slashing, while verified truth
earns Mahout proportional to the data's importance and difficulty of
verification. This creates a new form of mining where truth, not
computation, generates value.
