\section{Early Oracle Incentives}

The protocol recognizes that early data contributors take extraordinary risks and perform foundational work that enables all future network activity. Like Bitcoin's declining block rewards, early oracles receive enhanced Mahout rewards for establishing the initial property database. These pioneers don't just verify data---they establish standards, create processes, and build the reputation systems that later participants rely upon.

This front-loaded incentive structure serves multiple purposes. It attracts high-quality contributors when the network most needs them, rewards the risk of participating before network effects provide natural returns, and ensures rapid initial data coverage. Early oracles who prove themselves become the network's reputation anchors, their verified contributions serving as training data for AI systems and trust benchmarks for future verifiers.
