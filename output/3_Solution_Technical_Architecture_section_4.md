Truth enters the Elephant network through a sophisticated oracle validation system that balances decentralization with
data quality. The protocol collects property data from multiple independent oracle providers, each required to submit
off-chain cryptographic signatures for all data contributions. These submissions are aggregated into Merkle proofs for
efficient on-chain commitment, creating an audit trail that proves consensus without storing redundant data.

The staking framework functions as live economic attestation, where oracles put capital at risk to vouch for their data
quality. This creates escalating confidence layers---data verified by more oracles with higher stakes carries greater
trust weight. Unlike traditional systems where reputation is subjective and localized, Elephant creates objective,
transferable credibility that follows oracles across jurisdictions and time. The economic model transforms verification
from a cost center into a profit center for accurate participants. Where traditional systems pay repeatedly for data
verification that evaporates upon completion, Elephant invests in permanent verification that appreciates over time.
