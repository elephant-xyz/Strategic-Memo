The numbers tell a story of liberation from systematic extraction. Each property transaction currently costs \$67,155 in total friction. Under Elephant Protocol, this plummets to \$7,145—a \$60,010 per-transaction savings that represents approximately one year of pre-tax median household income freed from intermediary capture. Nationally, \$205.2 billion annually redirects from friction to productivity.

The macroeconomic impact represents 0.80% of 2024 GDP currently consumed by transaction friction, reduced to just 0.10% under the protocol—a net savings of 0.70% of GDP. According to standard economic multipliers used by the Congressional Budget Office, infrastructure and efficiency improvements generate 0.6-0.9x GDP impact through increased consumption and investment. The annual savings thus contributes approximately \$123-184 billion in additional economic activity achieved not through government spending but through efficiency gains.

Capital reallocation fundamentally shifts from rent-seeking to value creation. The billions currently captured by commission-based gatekeeping redirects toward property improvements, new construction, and productive investment. The excess interest hidden in rate manipulations returns to borrowers as increased purchasing power and reduced debt burdens. Every dollar freed from extraction multiplies through the economy as families spend on education, healthcare, and quality of life rather than transaction friction.

Elephant Protocol creates significant deflationary pressure—reducing transaction costs, lowering borrowing costs, and alleviating upward pressure on house prices. Properties can trade at their true values rather than inflated prices needed to cover excessive transaction costs. This deflationary effect compounds over time, making housing more affordable without requiring price controls or subsidies.
