\## Massive Economic Savings

The numbers tell a story of liberation from systematic extraction. Each
property transaction currently costs $67,155—16.3% of the average
$412,000 home value. Under the Elephant protocol, this plummets to
$7,145, just 1.7% of home value. For individual families, this $60,010
per-transaction savings represents nearly a full year of median
household income freed from intermediary capture. Nationally, $205.2
billion annually redirects from friction to productivity.

Breaking down the savings reveals where value liberation occurs.
Rate-embedded commissions, currently extracting $28,128 per transaction
through hidden mortgage manipulations, drop to zero as transparent
pricing exposes these schemes. Direct commissions fall from $26,606 to
$3,895 as professionals compete on service rather than gatekeeping. Data
verification costs plunge from $8,600 to $2,400 as permanent blockchain
records replace repeated validation. Technology expenses decrease from
$3,820 to $850 as unified infrastructure replaces fragmented systems.

The macroeconomic multiplier effects compound these direct savings. When
transaction costs consume 16.3% of property value, they create massive
deadweight loss—properties don’t trade to highest-value users, families
delay moves, investors avoid real estate. Reducing friction to 1.7%
unleashes pent-up economic activity. Conservative estimates suggest a
0.6-0.9x GDP multiplier as saved capital redirects to consumption,
investment, and productive enterprise rather than intermediary
extraction.

Capital reallocation fundamentally shifts from rent-seeking to value
creation. The $97 billion currently captured by commission-based
gatekeeping redirects toward property improvements, new construction,
and productive investment. The $77.3 billion hidden in rate
manipulations returns to borrowers as increased purchasing power and
reduced debt burdens. Every dollar freed from extraction multiplies
through the economy as families spend on education, healthcare, and
quality of life rather than transaction friction.

Household wealth accumulation accelerates dramatically when transaction
parasitism ends. A family staying in their home seven years currently
loses $9,594 annually to transaction costs—a hidden tax on
homeownership. This drops to $1,021 under Elephant, freeing $8,573
yearly for savings, investment, or consumption. Compounded over decades,
this difference transforms middle-class wealth trajectories from
stagnation to accumulation.
