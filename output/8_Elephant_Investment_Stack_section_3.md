Mining licenses function analogously to mineral rights or spectrum allocations, granting exclusive rights to verify specific property portfolios through smart contract mechanisms. The investment process operates transparently: investors transfer USDC to protocol treasury, institutional partnerships execute mining across targeted properties, and both MAHOUT and vMAHOUT tokens flow directly to investor-controlled wallets upon successful verification and consensus achievement.

Protocol governance receives management fees calculated as percentages of total license values, ensuring sustainable funding while maintaining investor alignment. License costs and renewal rates adjust dynamically through market-driven auctions, preventing speculative squatting while ensuring fair price discovery. Time-bounded structures require active mining commitments, guaranteeing continuous data contribution to network growth.

Economic returns scale proportionally with network share acquisition. License value per 1% of total properties combines token appreciation with gas rights revenue:
$$\text{License Value} = 1\% \times \$49.50 \times 150 \text{ million} + 1\% \times \$30.0 \text{ billion}$$
$$= \$74.3 \text{ million} + \$300 \text{ million} = \$374.3 \text{ million}$$

Geographic characteristics influence individual valuations based on property values, transaction frequencies, and local market dynamics. High-activity metropolitan areas generate more frequent updates and higher gas fee revenue, while luxury segments command premium pricing through competitive bidding. The structure also unlocks small capital investments from consumers seeking to bring their local areas on-chain as network advocates, increasing potential for grassroots adoption.
