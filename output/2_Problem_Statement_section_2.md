This centralized control creates a perverse economy where friction itself becomes the primary product. Intermediaries face an inherent principal-agent problemâ€”their interests align with transaction complexity, not resolution. Every additional step, every required approval, every mandated verification creates billable opportunities. The system profits from problems rather than solutions.

Fragmentation and forgetting represent core features of this extractive design. Fragmented systems require repeated aggregation and reconciliation across numerous counterparties per transaction. Inefficient processes must be repeated from scratch for every transaction. The absence of data memory forces full re-verification of title, appraisal, inspection, lien, and servicing data regardless of how recently these were confirmed. If you buy a house today and attempt to sell it tomorrow, you must start completely over and pay for everything again. This should be trivially simple yet the current system makes it impossibly expensive.

The incentive structure ensures continued inefficiency. No service providers benefit from providing better products at lower costs because their protected market positions eliminate competitive pressure. Even well-intentioned professionals find themselves trapped in extractive frameworks that force them to perpetuate inefficiencies or exit the market entirely.
