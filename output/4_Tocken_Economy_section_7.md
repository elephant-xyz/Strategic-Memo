MAHOUT supply grows deterministically with real-world property verification rather than arbitrary emission schedules.
With properties divided into fact groups, the maximum theoretical supply depends on the total number of properties and
their data complexity. However, practical supply remains much lower as not all properties require verification
simultaneously and some fact groups rarely change.

International expansion occurs through governance vote, where the protocol can issue tokens to incentivize verification
in new markets using the same mechanism. Each country's property count multiplied by locally-appropriate fact groupings
determines the potential token allocation. This ensures consistent economic incentives across jurisdictions while
allowing flexibility for varying data structures and regulatory requirements.

Long-term equilibrium emerges from balanced supply and demand. Oracle rewards for new verifications decrease as fewer
unverified properties remain, while update rewards for maintaining data quality continue indefinitely. Transaction fees
create continuous token demand while staking for advertisements locks supply. The burn mechanism from governance
transfers adds deflationary pressure. These forces create a sustainable economy where token value reflects network
utility rather than speculation.
