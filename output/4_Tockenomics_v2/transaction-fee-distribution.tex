\section{Transaction Fee Distribution}

Every real estate transaction conducted through the Elephant platform generates native fees that sustain the ecosystem. These fees, dramatically lower than traditional transaction costs due to automation and efficiency gains, are distributed between oracle rewards and DAO operational costs. This creates a self-sustaining economy where network usage directly funds network maintenance and improvement.

The fee structure replaces the current \$234.8 billion in annual transaction costs with a streamlined \$29.6 billion systemâ€”an 87\% reduction that benefits consumers while still providing sustainable economics for service providers. The massive efficiency gain comes from eliminating redundancy, automating coordination, and removing rent-seeking intermediaries who extract value without creating it.
