\chapter{Tokenomics}

The Elephant protocol introduces a work-based tokenomics model that fundamentally reimagines how value flows through real estate transactions. Unlike traditional systems where intermediaries extract \$234.8 billion annually through gatekeeping positions, our token economy rewards those who contribute verified truth to the network. Every token is earned through meaningful workâ€”there are no pre-sales, no insider allocations, and no passive farming mechanisms. This creates an economy where value accumulation directly correlates with value creation.
