# Transaction Fee Distribution

Every real estate transaction conducted through the Elephant platform
generates native fees that sustain the ecosystem. These fees,
dramatically lower than traditional transaction costs due to automation
and efficiency gains, are distributed between oracle rewards and DAO
operational costs. This creates a self-sustaining economy where network
usage directly funds network maintenance and improvement.

The fee structure replaces the current \$234.8 billion in annual
transaction costs with a streamlined \$29.6 billion system---an 87%
reduction that benefits consumers while still providing sustainable
economics for service providers. The massive efficiency gain comes from
eliminating redundancy, automating coordination, and removing
rent-seeking intermediaries who extract value without creating it.
