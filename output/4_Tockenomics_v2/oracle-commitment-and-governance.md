# Oracle Commitment and Governance

The protocol's governance model ties voting power directly to ongoing
contribution through the vMAHOUT mechanism. Unlike traditional
governance tokens that can be purchased or accumulated passively,
vMAHOUT is earned exclusively through verified data contributions. Each
successfully verified fact group awards 1 vMAHOUT to the contributing
oracle, creating a governance structure where those who build and
maintain the network control its future direction.

vMAHOUT implements a novel decay mechanism that ensures governance
remains in the hands of active contributors. Governance power decreases
by 1-2% weekly for oracles who stop contributing new verifications. If
another oracle updates a fact group previously maintained by an inactive
oracle, the inactive oracle loses their vMAHOUT for that group entirely.
This creates a governance system that naturally evolves with the
network, preventing the accumulation of dormant voting power.

The transferability restrictions on vMAHOUT further reinforce this
active participation requirement. Transfers between verified oracles
incur a 10-30% burn penalty, allowing for necessary operational
transitions while preventing speculative governance markets. This
ensures that network control remains distributed among those actively
building value rather than concentrated in the hands of passive
investors.
