The transformation of real estate from extractive monopoly to open marketplace requires more than visionâ€”it demands meticulous execution across technical infrastructure, market dynamics, and human behavior. This implementation roadmap translates revolutionary architecture into operational reality through four interlocking phases: bootstrapping the oracle network, dominating search through verified content, facilitating provider migration, and scaling globally. Each phase builds irreversibly on the previous, creating momentum that compounds from early adopters to market dominance.

Launch begins by activating oracle mining in targeted markets, requiring verifier onboarding, staking mechanisms, and data submission infrastructure. Verified on-chain content must be structured and surfaced to dominate SEO and AI search responses, initiating organic inbound demand. Provider tools and dApps must be deployed with onboarding support to facilitate app switching and incentivize adoption by real estate professionals. A scalable deployment framework must be established for entering new markets with minimal engineering lift, enabling global expansion.
