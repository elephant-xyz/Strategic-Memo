MAHOUT functions as the protocolâ€™s native currency, creating consistent demand through multiple economic channels. Gas fee payments for network transactions, staking requirements for oracle participation, and competitive advertising placements on property fact sheets establish multi-vector utility that extends beyond speculative trading into essential protocol operations.

Token valuation follows the quantity theory of money relationship $MV = PY$, where protocol transaction volume reaches \$29.7 billion annually, velocity maintains 4 cycles per year, and money supply remains fixed at 150 million tokens. This yields a calculated token price of:
$$\text{Token Price} = \frac{\$29.7 \text{ billion}}{4 \times 150 \text{ million}} = \$49.50$$

The fixed supply ceiling establishes absolute scarcity as the protocol expands. Only 150 million MAHOUT tokens will ever exist, ensuring price appreciation reflects the fundamental transition from centralized extraction to decentralized value creation. Each property integration increases transaction volume, each verified fact group generates gas fees, and each new participant creates incremental demand against the unchanging supply constraint.

This calculation captures the baseline value transfer from traditional intermediation to efficient digital infrastructure. It excludes additional growth potential from reduced transaction costs enabling new use cases, unlocked innovation opportunities, and novel financial products that emerge as traditional barriers dissolve.
