# Tokenomics

## Dual-Token Architecture

The Elephant protocol introduces a sophisticated dual-token system that aligns incentives more precisely than any single-token model could achieve. Mahout serves as the protocol's economic lifeblood---the currency that powers transactions, rewards contributions, and measures value. vMahout represents something more profound: active participation crystallized into governance power, where influence flows to those who build and maintain the network rather than those who merely hold tokens.

This separation solves the fundamental tension between speculation and utility that plagues most crypto protocols. Mahout can flow freely as currency while vMahout ensures that governance remains with active contributors. Unlike traditional governance tokens that reward passive holding, vMahout decays without participation, creating a dynamic where power naturally gravitates toward those actively improving the network. This design mirrors how reputation works in the physical world---earned through consistent contribution, maintained through ongoing engagement, lost through inactivity.

## Data-Driven Governance

Governance power in the Elephant protocol derives from data contribution, not capital deployment. Those who update property records, verify information, and maintain data quality earn vMahout proportional to their contributions. This creates a meritocracy where a dedicated data verifier in rural Kansas can accumulate more governance power than a passive whale in Manhattan. The system rewards work that directly improves network utility rather than mere token accumulation.

Contributors earn from gas fees when their verified data gets accessed, creating sustainable income streams tied to data quality and usage. The more valuable and frequently accessed your contributions, the more you earn and the stronger your governance voice becomes. This feedback loop ensures that those making decisions about the protocol's future are precisely those who understand its day-to-day operations and user needs. It's governance by practitioners rather than speculators---a model that aligns long-term protocol health with individual contributor success.

## Growth-Aligned Token Creation

Mahout creation directly correlates with real-world network expansion through property onboarding. As each U.S. property joins the network and receives its initial data verification, new Mahout enters circulation. This mechanism ensures token supply growth reflects actual utility growth rather than arbitrary emission schedules. When the network adds a thousand properties, it creates proportional token supply to service those properties' future transactions.

This design creates natural supply-demand equilibrium. More properties mean more transactions, which require more Mahout for fees and rewards. The token supply expands precisely when and where needed, preventing both artificial scarcity and inflationary dilution. As the protocol expands internationally, each country's property onboarding creates its own Mahout supply wave, funding local network growth through programmatic token creation rather than centralized allocation.

## Early Oracle Incentives

The protocol recognizes that early data contributors take extraordinary risks and perform foundational work that enables all future network activity. Like Bitcoin's declining block rewards, early oracles receive enhanced Mahout rewards for establishing the initial property database. These pioneers don't just verify data---they establish standards, create processes, and build the reputation systems that later participants rely upon.

This front-loaded incentive structure serves multiple purposes. It attracts high-quality contributors when the network most needs them, rewards the risk of participating before network effects provide natural returns, and ensures rapid initial data coverage. Early oracles who prove themselves become the network's reputation anchors, their verified contributions serving as training data for AI systems and trust benchmarks for future verifiers.

## Proof-of-Truth Mining

Mahout enters circulation through a revolutionary Proof-of-Truth consensus mechanism where oracles mine tokens by establishing verified facts about properties. Unlike proof-of-work's computational competition or proof-of-stake's capital requirements, Proof-of-Truth rewards the discovery and verification of accurate property data. Oracles compete to be first to verify new information, resolve conflicting records, and establish canonical truth that the network accepts as fact.

The mining process requires expertise, stake, and reputation. Oracles must understand property data, invest time in verification, and risk their reputation on accuracy. When multiple oracles submit data about a property, the network runs consensus to determine truth. Those who consistently provide accurate data that achieves consensus earn mining rewards. Incorrect submissions lead to slashing, while verified truth earns Mahout proportional to the data's importance and difficulty of verification. This creates a new form of mining where truth, not computation, generates value.

## Proof-of-Contribution Rewards

Beyond mining new Mahout through Proof-of-Truth, the protocol implements Proof-of-Contribution to reward real-world property transaction work. When buyers need homes shown, sellers require marketing, or transactions need inspections, the protocol posts these as tasks. Real estate agents earn Mahout by successfully showing properties and facilitating negotiations. Home inspectors receive rewards for thorough property examinations. Appraisers collect fees for accurate valuations. Each professional contributes their specialized expertise and receives compensation in Mahout proportional to their task's complexity and successful completion.

This transforms traditional real estate work into a transparent, performance-based economy. An agent doesn't earn a flat 3

## Hierarchical Data Valuation

Not all property data carries equal weight in the Mahout economy. The protocol implements sophisticated data hierarchy where authoritative sources---government registries, official recordings, tax records---earn premium rewards. These foundational data blocks require higher verification standards but provide the bedrock upon which all other data builds. An oracle who successfully verifies and imports official county records earns substantially more than one adding estimated values or property descriptions.

AI-enriched datasets occupy the next tier, where machine learning models process raw data into actionable insights. Oracles who train models to estimate property values, predict maintenance needs, or identify investment opportunities earn enhanced rewards proportional to their models' accuracy and usage. This incentivizes continuous improvement in data quality and analytical capability, transforming static records into dynamic intelligence that grows more valuable over time.

## vMahout Dynamics

vMahout operates unlike any governance token in the crypto ecosystem. Non-transferable under normal circumstances, it represents active participation rather than passive ownership. As oracles verify data, resolve disputes, and improve the protocol, they accumulate vMahout. But this power decays without continued contribution---miss verification cycles, ignore governance proposals, or cease data updates, and your influence gradually diminishes.

This decay mechanism ensures governance remains with active participants rather than early adopters who've moved on. However, the protocol recognizes legitimate succession needs. In cases of retirement, disability, or death, vMahout can transfer to designated successors who meet minimum reputation requirements. This preserves institutional knowledge while preventing governance capture by inactive holders. The result is a living governance system that adapts to changing participants while maintaining continuity.

The tokenomics create a virtuous cycle where contributing to the network directly benefits contributors, quality naturally improves through competition, and governance aligns with actual usage. This isn't just a payment system---it's an economic organism that grows stronger through use, rewards excellence over extraction, and ensures those who build the future also govern it.
