The decentralized remedy outlined in Chapter 2 requires specific technical architecture to transform real estate’s extractive foundations into transparent infrastructure. Where systematic forgetting and gatekeeping have created artificial scarcity, blockchain-based verification creates permanent memory and open access. This transformation demands more than philosophical intent—it requires concrete technical systems that make extraction impossible while making truth profitable.

Elephant Protocol deploys on existing Layer 2 chains to achieve immediate scalability while maintaining sub-cent transaction costs essential for high-volume property data operations. Like stablecoins that successfully bridged traditional finance with blockchain benefits, this technical architecture combines on-chain verification with off-chain storage through IPFS, creating a hybrid system that balances immutability with economic efficiency while working within existing legal frameworks. Rather than building another blockchain from scratch, we leverage proven infrastructure to focus engineering resources on the core challenge: creating a unified data layer that transforms fragmented property information into composable, verifiable digital assets.

Early design accepts single-chain limitations, with future releases introducing multi-chain interoperability and L2 bridging. Data availability is decentralized using IPFS, leveraging providers like Pinata for fast, resilient, and censorship-resistant storage. The primary objective is to capture, normalize, and mint the highest quality real estate data on-chain as fast as possible.
