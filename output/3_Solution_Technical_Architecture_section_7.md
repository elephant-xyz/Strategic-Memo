As the Discovery Engine demonstrates the value of transparent public data, privacy considerations become paramount for sensitive information. Elephant Protocol approaches privacy through careful phasing that builds trust while respecting sensitivity. Phase 1 focuses exclusively on public data sourcesâ€”county records, assessor data, and public title information. No private borrower or identity data is collected in initial stages, allowing the protocol to prove its value with non-controversial information. Phase 2 introduces privacy-preserving designs for sensitive financial data such as mortgage pre-approvals, income verification, and underwriting.

The protocol will apply identity-less cryptographic primitives and selective disclosure mechanisms, ensuring that private data can be verified without being exposed. Zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized identity frameworks will enable compliant borrower-side data handling while maintaining individual privacy. This phased approach acknowledges that trust must be earned, not assumed.

The privacy architecture ensures that sensitive information remains protected while enabling the verification necessary for transactions. Mathematical proofs replace trust relationships, allowing parties to verify claims without revealing underlying data. This creates a system where privacy and transparency coexist, serving both individual rights and market efficiency.
