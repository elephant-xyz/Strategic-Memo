Elephant approaches privacy through careful phasing that builds trust while respecting sensitivity. Phase 1 focuses
exclusively on public data sources---county records, assessor data, and public title information. No private borrower or
identity data is collected in initial stages, allowing the protocol to prove its value with non-controversial
information. Phase 2 introduces privacy-preserving designs for sensitive financial data such as mortgage pre-approvals,
income verification, and underwriting.

The protocol will apply identity-less cryptographic primitives and selective disclosure mechanisms, ensuring that
private data can be verified without being exposed. Zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized identity frameworks will
enable compliant borrower-side data handling while maintaining individual privacy. This phased approach acknowledges
that trust must be earned, not assumed.
