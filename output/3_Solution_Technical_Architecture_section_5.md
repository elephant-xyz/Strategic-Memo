The Lexicon represents Elephant’s answer to decades of data fragmentation in real estate—but crucially, it functions not just as a canonical language but as a universal translator between existing standards. Instead of forcing the entire industry to adopt yet another data format, the Lexicon ingests and translates between MLS schemas, county record formats, title company structures, and countless other proprietary systems. This translation capability eliminates adoption friction while creating interoperability where none existed before.

The model unifies multiple real estate data standards into a deeply relational, normalized structure optimized for ownership changes, mortgage payoffs, upgrades, and regulatory complexity. Properties are not simple objects but complex entities with relationships, histories, and futures. The Lexicon captures these dimensions while remaining queryable, updatable, and verifiable. It powers consistent cross-jurisdictional data interoperability, enabling a property record from New York to seamlessly integrate with systems in California, Tokyo, or London—all while preserving local data requirements and formats.

By serving as both canonical truth and universal translator, the Lexicon solves the industry’s babel problem without requiring unanimous agreement on standards. Legacy systems continue operating in their native formats while the protocol handles translation transparently. This pragmatic approach accelerates adoption by meeting the industry where it is without demanding wholesale transformation.
