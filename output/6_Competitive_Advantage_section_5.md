The misaligned incentives described above are reinforced by deliberate knowledge fragmentation that maximizes friction and monetization opportunities. The current system segments expertise across multiple specialist roles, with each professional understanding only narrow aspects of the complete transaction process. This fragmentation serves the interests of specialist groups by creating dependencies that justify their positions, but it also creates massive inefficiencies and coordination failures that compound costs for consumers.

Real estate agents focus on marketing and negotiation but remain largely disconnected from lending, legal, and technical requirements. Mortgage brokers understand financing but lack deep knowledge of property evaluation, legal processes, or technology systems. Each knowledge silo requires separate relationship management, creating multiple principal-agent problems within individual transactions and preventing the systematic optimization that integrated knowledge would enable.

Building Elephant Protocol requires deep, interdisciplinary knowledge across real estate, lending, legal, technical, and regulatory domains simultaneously. Teams must maintain capabilities across API systems, serverless architecture, tokenized finance, and legal compliance while understanding operational transaction realities. This knowledge integration represents a fundamental barrier to entry that most industry participants cannot overcome without abandoning their existing business models and starting entirely new approaches.
