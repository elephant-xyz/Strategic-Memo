Elephant’s smart contracts function as an autonomous process manager, eliminating gatekeepers by automating the
coordination that currently requires multiple intermediaries. Rather than relying on legal contracts interpreted by
humans, the protocol embeds its rules directly into code that executes automatically and impartially. This fundamental
shift unlocks task-based service provider roles—when the protocol manages process flow, professionals can focus on their
specific expertise rather than coordination overhead.

The governance system controls permissioned data minting and record issuance, ensuring that only verified data from
consensus-validated oracles can create official property records. Automated dispute resolution and data correction
workflows replace the current system where errors can persist for years. The contracts support upgradeable logic,
allowing protocol evolution without disrupting existing records or relationships. By eliminating process gatekeeping,
the protocol enables the $60,010 per-transaction savings—professionals compete on service quality rather than access
control, driving costs down while improving outcomes.

Oracle participation rules embedded in smart contracts create a meritocratic marketplace for truth verification. Data
providers stake MAHOUT tokens against their submissions, with slashing penalties applied for malicious or inaccurate
data post-minting. This economic alignment ensures that participants profit from accuracy rather than obfuscation,
reversing the current system’s perverse incentives.
