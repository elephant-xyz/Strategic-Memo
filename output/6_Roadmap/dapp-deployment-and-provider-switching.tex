\section{dApp Deployment and Provider Switching}

The initial service-specific dApps—title verification, property appraisal, and escrow management—demonstrate immediate utility rather than abstract potential. Each dApp solves specific pain points with dramatic improvements: title searches that took days complete in minutes, appraisals backed by comparable sales data update automatically, escrow releases triggered by smart contract conditions rather than manual approval. These aren't incremental improvements but step-function advances that make switching inevitable for rational actors.

SDKs and APIs transform integration from obstacle to opportunity. Traditional software requires months of implementation; our SDKs enable integration in days. The APIs don't just expose data—they provide intelligent abstractions that handle complexity while maintaining flexibility. A mortgage broker can integrate automated property verification without understanding Merkle trees. An appraiser can access comparable sales without writing smart contracts. We hide the complexity while exposing the capability.

Onboarding flows for providers acknowledge that switching costs extend beyond technology to psychology. The interface mirrors familiar workflows while gradually introducing new capabilities. Import tools transfer existing client relationships, transaction histories, and document templates. Training modules provide bite-sized education embedded within actual usage. Providers don't study blockchain—they use better tools that happen to be blockchain-powered. The revolution hides in the familiar.

Wallet-based identity and reputation create portable professional equity. A real estate agent's verified transaction history, client satisfaction scores, and specialization credentials live onchain, owned by them rather than platforms. This portability inverts power dynamics—professionals no longer fear leaving platforms that exploit them because their reputation travels with them. The best providers gain pricing power while poor performers face market accountability. Merit replaces monopoly.

Adoption incentive programs accelerate the transition through carefully calibrated economics. Zero-fee trial transactions let providers experience benefits without risk. Routing rewards direct early clients to verified providers. Staking rewards for consistent platform usage create recurring income streams. But these incentives phase out as network effects take hold—we jumpstart adoption, not subsidize it indefinitely. The goal is sustainable superiority, not artificial growth.
