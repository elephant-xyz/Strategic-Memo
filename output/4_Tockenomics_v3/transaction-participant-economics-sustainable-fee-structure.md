# Transaction Participant Economics: Sustainable Fee Structure

Every real estate transaction conducted through the Elephant platform
generates native fees that sustain the ecosystem without extracting
value. These fees, totaling approximately \$700 per transaction, fund
both oracle rewards and DAO operational costs. Compared to the current
\$67,155 average transaction cost, this represents a 99% reduction in
direct transaction fees while still maintaining robust economics for all
participants.

The fee structure breaks down into specific allocations: oracle rewards
for maintaining property data (approximately \$350), DAO treasury for
development and operations (\$200), and system maintenance including gas
cost subsidies (\$150). This transparent allocation ensures every dollar
serves a specific purpose rather than disappearing into opaque
\"processing\" or \"administrative\" fees.

Transaction fees also create natural token demand as they must be paid
in MAHOUT, establishing a consumption mechanism that balances token
emission from oracle rewards. As transaction volume grows, fee demand
increases, supporting token value while funding expanded oracle
operations. This creates a virtuous cycle where growth self-funds
infrastructure expansion.
