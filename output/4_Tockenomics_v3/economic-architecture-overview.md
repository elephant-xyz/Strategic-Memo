# Economic Architecture Overview

Three distinct participant roles drive the Elephant economy, each with
aligned incentives that reinforce system integrity. Oracles earn MAHOUT
tokens by bringing verified property data on-chain and maintaining its
accuracy over time. Service providers stake MAHOUT to advertise on
property fact sheets, creating a competitive marketplace for
professional services. Transaction participants pay modest fees that
fund ongoing operations and reward contributors. This triangular economy
ensures sustainable growth: more properties create more fact sheets,
attracting more service providers, generating more fees, incentivizing
more oracles, who verify more properties.

The genius lies in making honesty more profitable than deception at
every level. Oracles who submit accurate data earn tokens and governance
power. Those who submit false data lose their stakes and reputation.
Service providers who deliver quality attract clients through prominent
placement. Those who disappoint see their staked positions challenged by
competitors. Every economic mechanism reinforces the core principle:
value creation beats value extraction.
