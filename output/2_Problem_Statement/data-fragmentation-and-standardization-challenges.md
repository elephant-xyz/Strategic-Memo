# Data Fragmentation and Standardization Challenges

Modern real estate transactions require coordination across seventeen
separate systems, none designed to communicate with others. This
fragmentation costs \$8,100 per transaction in redundant data entry,
verification, and reconciliation. Each system maintains its own records,
formats, and access controls, creating exponential complexity as
information moves between parties.

The absence of standardization extends beyond technical incompatibility.
Even when systems could theoretically share data, business models depend
on information asymmetry. Title companies profit from searching records
that previous searches already found. Inspectors examine properties
previously inspected. Appraisers value homes with extensive comparable
data. Each charges full price for partial work because the system lacks
memory---by design, not accident.

Manual aggregation becomes necessary for every transaction component.
Loan officers re-enter data from real estate contracts. Title agents
cannot access lender requirements electronically. Inspectors submit
reports incompatible with appraisal software. This coordination overhead
compounds costs while creating delays and errors that further burden all
parties. The \$45.4 billion spent annually on data costs reflects not
information value but friction from fragmentation.
