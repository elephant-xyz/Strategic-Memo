# Gatekeepers and Market Structure

The real estate industry's gatekeeping structure extracts \$339.3
billion annually through controlled access rather than value creation.
Every transaction layer imposes access fees justified by regulatory
requirements or information control. MLS organizations charge thousands
for data access. Title insurance companies collect \$4,000 for
protection against their own record-keeping failures. Lenders add
margins justified by \"relationship value\" that amounts to phone calls
and emails.

Recent legal challenges, particularly the NAR settlement, highlight
growing recognition that current structures cannot persist. Yet
litigation addresses symptoms rather than architecture. Reducing visible
commission percentages without eliminating commission financing merely
shifts extraction from transparent to hidden mechanisms. True reform
requires fundamental reconstruction of how property transactions occur,
not marginal adjustments to existing extraction systems.

Market evolution creates unprecedented disruption opportunities for
protocol solutions. Consumer awareness of transaction costs reaches
all-time highs. Regulatory pressure mounts on traditional gatekeepers.
Technology maturity enables alternatives previously impossible. The
convergence of these forces opens a window for architectural
transformation that eliminates gatekeeping through mathematical trust
and automated execution. The question is not whether change will come,
but who will build the infrastructure for property's next century.
