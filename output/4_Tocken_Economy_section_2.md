The diverse nature of real estate data requires different verification approaches, which is why the protocol distinguishes between consensus-based groups and reputation-based groups. This distinction reflects the fundamental difference between objective, verifiable facts that multiple parties can independently confirm from the same sources, and subjective assessments or specialized access that require reputation staking and individual expertise.

Consensus-based groups require three unique oracle submissions to validate objective, verifiable facts that multiple parties can independently confirm from the same sources. These groups distribute MAHOUT according to submission order: 80% to the first oracle, 15% to the second oracle, and 5% to the third oracle. This submission-order reward structure incentivizes speed while ensuring redundant verification from multiple independent sources.

Three vMAHOUT tokens are minted per consensus group submission cycle, one for each of the three oracles. This design ensures that governance power flows from verified contributions rather than economic stakes, creating alignment between network utility and decision-making authority.

Reputation-based groups such as Photo Metadata, HOA, and certain specialized assessments like appraisals and inspections award 100% of their MAHOUT allocation to a single oracle. Oracles must stake reputation to contribute to these groups, which involve subjective assessment or specialized access rather than objective verification. Non-consensus groups do not mint any vMAHOUT tokens, focusing purely on MAHOUT rewards for data contribution.

This dual structure prevents the system from falling into either extreme: pure consensus would paralyze subjective assessments, while pure reputation would enable manipulation of objective facts. The protocol recognizes that different types of truth require different verification mechanismsâ€”a design principle that scales from individual properties to entire markets.
