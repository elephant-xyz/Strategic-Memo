Oracles form the backbone of Elephant's economy, transforming real-world property data into blockchain-verified truth.
The protocol divides each property into 20 independent fact groups---ownership, mortgages, liens, permits, valuations,
and others---each requiring verification from three independent oracles who must reach unanimous consensus. This
granular approach enables getting as much data as possible on-chain as fast as possible, rather than waiting for
complete property records before beginning verification.

The reward structure creates urgency without sacrificing accuracy. For each fact group successfully verified, exactly 1
MAHOUT token is minted and distributed: approximately 81% to the first oracle, 16% to the second, and 3% to the third.
This exponential curve derives from game theory principles that balance first-mover advantages with the need for
verification redundancy. The steep reward gradient incentivizes rapid response---being first matters---while still
providing meaningful compensation for validators who ensure accuracy.

Being first is hardest because pioneers must develop data sourcing methods, build verification workflows, and establish
quality standards without existing templates. These early oracles create the infrastructure that makes future oracle
work significantly easier. They document data sources, automate verification processes, and establish best practices
that subsequent oracles can leverage. The exponential reward curve compensates these pioneers for both their
verification work and their pathfinding efforts that benefit the entire network.

Oracle participation requires staking MAHOUT tokens, with higher stakes earning priority access to unverified properties
entering the system. This stake faces slashing penalties for submitting false data, creating skin in the game that
ensures dedication to accuracy. The economic model transforms data verification from a cost center into a profit center
for diligent oracles.
