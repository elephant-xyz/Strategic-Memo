The coordination that maintains pricing stability also prevents the operational discipline that might otherwise emerge from competitive pressure. Industry participants demonstrate a peculiar relationship with profitability that actively prevents competitive pricing or operational efficiency. Rather than optimizing for sustainable margins, companies allow their cost structures to expand with available revenue, leaving no room for price competition when market conditions change.

This pattern appears consistently across all industry segments. Most real estate brokerages operate without consistent profitability across market cycles, depending on volume rather than efficiency to sustain operations. When transaction volumes increase, companies hire aggressively and expand overhead rather than improving per-unit economics. When volumes decline, mass layoffs and office closures create operational disruption that prevents systematic efficiency improvements, making long-term technology investments or process optimization practically impossible.

The cyclical nature of boom-bust operations reinforces this dynamic. Companies cannot justify systematic efficiency improvements when their survival depends on navigating unpredictable volume cycles. Industry profitability hinges on episodic events—particularly refinancing booms—where temporary market conditions create windfall profits that subsidize inefficient operations during normal periods. This creates systematic underinvestment in the infrastructure and capabilities that would enable sustainable competitive advantages.
