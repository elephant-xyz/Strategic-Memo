The transformation of real estate from an extractive industry consuming \$234.8 billion annually to an efficient market requiring only \$29.6 billion represents more than cost savings---it catalyzes fundamental economic and social restructuring. When \$205.2 billion redirects from intermediary extraction to productive use, the effects ripple through household wealth, capital markets, and social mobility. This 89% reduction in transaction friction doesn't merely save money; it reimagines property as a liquid, accessible, programmable asset class that serves humanity rather than gatekeepers.
