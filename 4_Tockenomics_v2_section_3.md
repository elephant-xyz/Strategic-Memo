\## Proof of Truth Mining

The Proof of Truth mechanism represents a fundamental departure from
traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms. While Proof of Work
consumes energy to secure computational puzzles and Proof of Stake
allocates power based on wealth, Proof of Truth creates value by
verifying real-world information and bringing it on-chain permanently.

All MAHOUT tokens originate through Proof of Truth mining. The genesis
supply begins at zero, with every token in circulation earned by oracles
who successfully verify property data. This creates an economy where
token distribution directly reflects contribution to the network’s core
value proposition—creating a comprehensive, verified, real-time property
database.

The mining process requires oracles to stake MAHOUT tokens to
participate in verification tasks. Higher stakes provide priority access
to new, unverified data entering the system. However, stakes are at
risk—submitting false data or failing to maintain assigned fact groups
results in stake slashing. This economic mechanism ensures that only
serious, capable participants engage in truth verification, maintaining
the network’s integrity.
