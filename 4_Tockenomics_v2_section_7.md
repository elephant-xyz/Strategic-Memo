\## Supply Growth Dynamics

MAHOUT’s supply growth is intrinsically tied to real-world asset
verification rather than arbitrary emission schedules. As more
properties are added to the network and verified by oracles, new tokens
are minted to reward the verification work. This creates a natural
correlation between token supply and network utility—more tokens exist
only when more verified property data exists to support them.

The total potential token supply is effectively capped by the number of
properties in existence multiplied by the fact groups per property. With
approximately 140 million properties in the United States and 20 fact
groups per property, the maximum theoretical supply would be 2.8 billion
MAHOUT tokens. However, practical supply will be much lower as
properties are gradually onboarded and some fact groups may not require
updates for extended periods.

This supply model creates unique economic dynamics. Early oracles can
accumulate tokens more easily as unverified properties are plentiful. As
the network matures and most properties are verified, new token emission
slows naturally, creating scarcity that rewards early contributors while
maintaining incentives for ongoing maintenance.
