\chapter{Real Estate Blockchain Projects Compared}

While many real estate platforms claim blockchain innovation, most fall short of its foundational ideals. As outlined by Andreas M. Antonopoulos in \textit{The Internet of Money}, a true blockchain system should deliver decentralization, trustless validation, permissionless access, user sovereignty, and elimination of intermediaries.

Most solutions merely bolt blockchain onto legacy systems, preserving traditional power structures. This evaluation highlights key projects based on core decentralization principles:

Only Elephant Protocol fully embraces decentralization: eliminating intermediaries, enabling trustless validation, and granting open access to all participants. Other projects maintain dependency on agents, centralized controls, or regulatory gateways that contradict the ethos of user sovereignty.

This distinction matters. Tokenization alone doesn’t disrupt real estate’s structural inefficiencies. To unlock blockchain’s true impact, platforms must be decentralized by design—not merely in branding.

Elephant Protocol demonstrates how blockchain can genuinely replace traditional infrastructure, not reinforce it. Its architecture shows that meaningful transformation is possible when systems are built from first principles rather than retrofitted for optics.
