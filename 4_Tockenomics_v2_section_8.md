\## Economic Alignment

The protocol’s economic design aligns all participant incentives toward
creating and maintaining accurate property data. Oracles profit by
finding and verifying truth. Property owners benefit from free,
permanent, verified records of their assets. Service providers compete
on merit rather than gatekeeping positions. Consumers save 89% on
transaction costs while gaining transparency and choice.

This alignment solves the fundamental problem in current real estate
markets where intermediaries profit from friction and information
asymmetry. By making truth verification profitable and gatekeeping
unprofitable, Elephant creates an economy where participant success
directly correlates with value creation rather than value extraction.
The result is a sustainable, growing ecosystem that becomes more
valuable to all participants as it expands.

In the chapters that follow, we explore how this tokenomic foundation
enables massive economic savings, new market layers, and fundamental
social change. The tokens are not merely speculative assets—they are the
fuel for a new economy built on verified truth and aligned incentives.
