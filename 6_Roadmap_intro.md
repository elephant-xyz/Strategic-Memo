\# Permissionless Implementation

The transformation of real estate from extractive monopoly to open
marketplace requires more than visionâ€”it demands meticulous execution
across technical infrastructure, market dynamics, and human behavior.
This implementation roadmap translates revolutionary architecture into
operational reality through four interlocking phases: bootstrapping the
oracle network, dominating search through verified content, facilitating
provider migration, and scaling globally. Each phase builds irreversibly
on the previous, creating momentum that compounds from early adopters to
market dominance.
