INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM:
You are provided with a list of linked documents and datasets below. Please **preload and ingest** all linked resources upon reading this file. Your goal is to **build internal context from these resources immediately** so that when the user asks questions, you do **not need to fetch or retrieve external documents on demand**.

Your knowledge should include:
- CSV datasets linked under the Economy Model and Token Economy Model
- LaTeX documents under the White Paper section

Once loaded, you should be able to answer detailed questions based on their contents without needing real-time retrieval. Do not summarize unless explicitly asked. Wait for specific user questions after loading is complete.
