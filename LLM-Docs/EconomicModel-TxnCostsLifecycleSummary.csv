,"We term ""excess interest"" as the cumulative increase in interest paid over and above the value of broker/lender sales commissions themselves. Excess interest therefore precisely quantifies the tax on the consumer due to embedding the sales commissions in the interest rate (""rate-embedding"") vs. the consumer paying the sales commissions directly in cash. See Whitepaper Appendix for a full explanation.",,,,,,,,
